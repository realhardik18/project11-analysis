I think best sound design in a game is sifu(of a similar genre) \nIn seikiro, hear the metal cling sound when you parry perfectly and I see a lot of seikro in it but i think the target lock in a person needs to be toggle switch like in jedi fallen order. By default target lock should be off.\n\nThe environment is great but the AMBIANCE feels all over the place ,(just check sifu, each level  has a theme even with respect to colours too(if I'm not wrong they use Analogous colors in each level) \nLies of p colour is blue with a dark environment\nRight now from what you showed it looks like a mundane day in India.

With such a limited team and limited resources Varun bhaiya's team has done an astonishing work in such a short amount of time, and I have really high hopes for it. Keep it up Varun bhaiya.

I would rate  the gameplay 7/10 (fighting system can more good ) animation 8/10(make it more smooth) concept of environment 2/10(its just pain to watch).

Even looking at the trailer it feels quite choppy. \n2) that's amazing that you and your people are working hard for this but  the game needs to well managed I guess working only 1-2 years on triple A games and publishing it is not worth it.  It looks great but find some ideas and take some time to make things even better for a great experience\n3) looking at the trailer chatecter model looks quite unrealistic. Especially in combat where blood scatters in unrealistic way. Like adding wounds on damaged ones would make it lot more better \n4)  while looking the facial movement features should be added like in combat chatecter should look aggressive doing so will make the game even more immersive. \n5) that's great you and your team has put lot of efforts but adding different combat styles and finishing move would be great \n \nThese are my perspective and some suggestion hope you find this well ‚ù§‚ù§",

Too early to make any big judgments just yet, though. I'm honestly surprised you got this far in just 8 months and have it slated for release next year already when typical development cycles take 4-5 years these days.

If you are making a game at global level for global audience, also show the modern India and places which are world class, super clean, and still have an Indian touch. Don't let non Indians belittle and mock us anymore. Infact completely remove slum areas from your game and show posh areas of Mumbai if the game is set in Mumbai only and does not explore other cities of India.\n\nAnd you guys are free to take 5-6 even 8-10 yrs to make the game for PS8 and RTX 8050.",

Secondly what i dont understand is when a big company like rockstar keeps it game dev journey absolutely hidden why are you showing a half baked poduct right now? something is fishy.",

I understand that this is supposed to be a souls-like game but if there could be something done that would make the combat seem unique, it would really set this game apart.\nBecause after all the tremendous efforts your team has put in, I would hate for the world to label this as a ‚Äúcheap copy of Sekiro‚Äù without even trying it. (Because the world is filled with yappers and unfortunately, these yappers make or break greatness) \nThat being said, there is no doubt your efforts will make every Indian proud. \nThank you for doing what nobody else would. I hope this causes a revolution in the Indian gaming industry (and the world).",

        "text": "Hat's off to you. As someone wrote, make for the world, not for India. \nA bit of caution: While we do have mythologies, it is also important to respect people's beliefs and not trivialize things just for making entertainment for the world. It's fine to take inspiration from mythologies but using characters should be done cautiously and respectfully. It is better not to put any gods in the game. Like we don't want a situation where a god like thor is having romance.  Also, if it is mythology inspired, then it is encouraged to also make it meaningful.  \n\nAs for the game itself, i would say make it more than just India's souls-like. It should have some memorable features that are not in any Souls game but people enjoy that a lot. Idk, maybe aerial fights or flying. Maybe include controllable spatial and time powers. And make the world more alive where not everyone wants to attack you lol. Include things like cows maybe. And please don't get restricted due to 'India's first soul-like': it's just about being a but more creative and having a bit more ideas, which can elevate the game to a whole new level. And since it is based in India, an lot of ancient Indian weapons can be included which i am sure you are including. Even mythological weapons like Sudarshan chakra can be cool. You can also add things like temples, where fight is forbidden, giving respect can unlock some powers or heal and there could be some teachings there as well. As in sleeping dogs, in buddhist shrines, lighting incense increases health bar. In the end, i wohld again emphasize, do not be constrained by the term Souls-like. U could create situations where we are traveling on a ship and are fighting in a ship, it's not one vs all situation but there can be necessary ncp allies as well.",

But still there is work to be done on these things because the better these things will be, fighting skills, fighting animations, taking damage, interaction with the player, with NPP, with the enemy, with one's own body You will enjoy the game play just as much Even if you make some changes(low) to the graphics, improve these things.",

According to me this particular slum type theme is best suitable for COD like stealth mission based gameplay not for this one this kind of gameplay is best suited in the Himalayas or kedarnath type of religious areas and villains also should be more mythological or supernatultal vibed not a police man or a woman this is not gta bro. But apart from this the sound design, the game design, animations, vfx is 10 on 10.\n\n keep working on this project and make standard to compete internationally we arr always here to motivate you.‚ù§",

Its not wrong to take inspiration from another game but should not copy the whole thing exactly. Like shrine as a checkpoint, sword seems like katana movement, death blow looks like owls mikiri counter, the word appearing on screen when a serious attack is coming, posture bar etc etc. Black myth handled the game mechanics properly to get a souls like feel. Here I am pointing about only game mechanics not graphics.\nIf you want to stand out in the world, honestly with this its impossible. You need to reformulate the game mechanics again to make it different from other games. Even top tier graphic games fail due to poor game mechanics. I am not blaming about graphics which I can understand with small team you are building but you also need to change the art style to be good. But biggest priority should be game mechanics improvement. Honestly you will receive a lot of hate from hard core fans of souls games. The people in comment section are not aware of this and hence supporting. I have no right to judge you, but I am suggesting you because I want Indian gaming industry to thrive and this game at beta stage. So it can still be improved . Wish you all the best!!",

You are making a game not a movie, so focus on the gameplay mechanic first. Its choppy, sloppy, and doesn't feel fun. It's like those old phone game, space shooter and stuff, but with better graphics. \n\nHeres what I suggest, for player, make his swings sharp. By that I mean delete some frames in his animation so the swing of the weapon feels like a gun shot. To make it seem more powerful, some particle effects on hit can work. In souls like, victory over enemies must feel earned. So instead, try making enemies with a non subtle variety of attacks, and give them some characteristics. \nBy characteristics, I mean like imagine two different kind of enemies, a heavy guy and a light guy. Heavy guy's attack will be telegraphed, but he will attack strong. His defense will be High as well, and some change in sound effects may do the trick while fighting him (A feedback mechanism will be good too). The light guy will fight fast and will drain your hp if you are not quick enough. Do the same thing with his attacks as you did with the player. Heres another thing.\nI mean seriously, I can't really anymore more about this, but it feels like a 3d project rather than, well, a 'game'.",

India is a nation of vast diversity, rich culture, and breathtaking landscapes‚Äîfrom the snow-capped Himalayas and lush backwaters of Kerala to the architectural marvels of Rajasthan and the vibrant skylines of modern cities like Bengaluru and Mumbai. Reducing this incredible country to a single stereotype is not only lazy storytelling, but also deeply disrespectful to the millions who take pride in their heritage and progress.\n\nSuch representation fuels the global misconception that India equals poverty, ignoring the fact that the nation is also home to one of the world‚Äôs fastest-growing economies, a booming tech industry, and a youthful, innovative population. Developers and content creators have a responsibility to portray cultures with depth and nuance‚Äînot with tired clich√©s. While it‚Äôs true that every country has its struggles, it‚Äôs unfair to highlight only the flaws while ignoring the beauty, resilience, and brilliance that define its people. It's time for the world to see India beyond the slums, and recognize the elegance, energy, and excellence it truly embodies.",

I know tech aur morden india dikhana inke bas ki nhi hai so lets hope ki utna ghatiya game na ho jitna trailer me dikhaya gya hai..",

In the gameplay you showed there were a few things I felt were missing, especially when it came to the sound design.\n\nDuring combat with mid-tier or low-tier enemies, the sounds and character dialogues didn‚Äôt feel very immersive. It lacked that emotional pull or intensity. Also, the world around you should feel alive even when you‚Äôre just moving through it. Ghost of Tsushima does a good job with ambient sounds like rustling grass, birds chirping, foxes, and some NPC interactions. The Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2, those NPCs and their interactions felt much more immersive and dynamic.\n\nAll the best! Looking forward to play this!",

From the mechanics to even the animations and indicators, *everything* about the combat shown in that trailer looks like it was reskinned from Sekiro, and for the first AAA game from India to be a Sekiro reskin really doesn't sit right with me... I hope you can still take the game in a different direction because I'm really excited about its prospect, but this is *not* the way to go about designing your core systems.",

        "text": "I can clearly see that the game is heavily inspired by sekiro. But as a souls like game you should explore different games based on this genre as it will help to create a unique game rather than a souls like clone. For Now You should focus on smooth animations. The attack and deflect animations look very choppy ( fix their timing and increase their spacing )  and also the deathblow animation need a massive overhaul as it feel very weird. And work on skill trees and add different tools variety which will help gamers to play with different strategies. The Game needs so much work so don't rush it. Take atleast 3-4 years imo to polish the game properly. You can also release a demo version so that you will get gamers response to improve your game just like The First Berserker Khazan did.

Many teams opt for smaller-scale titles, but you‚Äôve tackled something far more substantial‚Äîand that‚Äôs truly commendable.\n\n‚Äì The visuals are gorgeous, and it‚Äôs clear the art team has poured their hearts into achieving this level of polish.\n\n ‚ÄìThe Movement Looks nice.\n\nThe Bad\nDisclaimer: I‚Äôm an aspiring game dev as well with far less experience than your team; my thoughts come purely from a player/consumer perspective.\n\n ‚ÄìGameplay, gameplay, gameplay. If you‚Äôre marketing this as a ‚ÄúSouls‚Äëlike,‚Äù the combat needs to feel engaging, challenging, and‚Äîyes‚Äîpunishing. You‚Äôve cited Sekiro as inspiration, which means we need fast-paced, precise, and fluid combat mechanics. Right now, aside from the Kshudita Asura (which I genuinely enjoyed), most fights feel generic and lacklustre‚Äîalmost like a watered-down imitation. I hope I‚Äôm proven wrong at launch, but at present, it doesn‚Äôt feel as refined as Sekiro or Lies of P, both of which nail that ‚Äúflow state‚Äù of combat.\n\n ‚ÄìSetting suggestion (personal preference): The city-and-slum aesthetic doesn‚Äôt quite resonate with the epic, mythic tone you seem to be aiming for. My suggestion would be to lean into a world inspired by classical Indian culture and history‚Äîthink rural landscapes, grand raja/maharaja‚Äìera architecture, and tasteful modern touches (like period‚Äëinspired firearms). That way, the Ramayana‚Äëinspired narrative can truly shine without feeling out of place.\n\nAgain, these are just my thoughts‚Äîyou‚Äôve already achieved a lot, and I sincerely hope the final game not only meets but exceeds these expectations!",

I know this is an alpha, but these are my thoughts:\n1) The character's leg animation, I loved it mostly.\n2) The dirt interactions on the ground.\n3) The overall setting and background looks promising \n\nNow to the imp parts.\n1) The name of game, ui, hud look way too generic. The name could be something very imdicative of the narration or character, if you think of it the name suites many fantasy AAA games..where a power is unleashed. The Ui should be such which prompts to player to start the game. It should be a part of the story. The hud, i think it's overly being indianized, just to be indian, a national pride is awesome but shouldn't overshadow the game. As in an american game or a chinese game wont shout chinese out. So keep some things like the hud minimalistic yet original to the game.\n2) If the gameplay showcased is an actual part of the story, then it's lackluster, as in..there's not much context..im pretty sure there's more to it! \n3) The charater movements and attacks shouldn't be just a button click and animate..it should feel cohesive. \n4) Character eye contact and expressions should be improved (I liked that giant mans face after that show off, excellent for an alpha of the build)\n\nI'll edit if I notice more, full support. Nail it. \nDon't just creat a fantasic product but also do fantastic marketing to get it put there. Do large collabs, celebs, actors...if both aspects are in place, I'm sure you'll nail it.

The gameplay, the story, the character, the locations, the atmosphere, and much more. The game play feels very lacking. You keep talking about how much efforts went into making the assets and scaning them n etc but truthfully no one cares. You are making a game not creating a animation studio or something like that all games do it. Heck there are games that have hand drawn graphics and those games are really good and millions of people play them. So focus more on making a polished bug free game with unique combat mechanics. Also dont go about saying we worked so hard on this we did this n that so many sleepless nights wagera wagera. No one cares. All gaming studious are doing what you are doing. It is not something that is new. Also the ui really sucks and so does the sound design.",

But, I wanted to highlight a small thing, and perhaps a different perspective/take.\n\n- The game looks great. But it won't matter much if the performance is not that good. Whatever happens, the game should run consistently well and bug-free at 60fps+. That would be my personal number one priority, even over the graphics. I am prepared to play a game with mediocre graphics if it has a good and engaging story and runs wells. It may be early days, but the first look and gameplay did not look so smooth. The animations look jittery, missing frames, etc. I am sure with the crew you have those will not be overlooked. Hopefully later on with more polish the game FEELS good, not just look good. MOBAs are a good example of this.\n\n- The story HAS to be engaging. It can be a short 10-15 hour story, but it has to hook the players till the end. Even if it means less side quests and collectibles. Sifu is a great example of a brilliantly done short game.\n\nBest of luck to you guys and you are doing an awesome job. Keep up the good work!",

Will you have enough time, \n\nNow this is for most , but yes financially indipendent people have grown a lot in india doesn't mean they make the majority of indians. \n\nYou're already studying till 24 -26 you need experience to get anything in this life and no one is willing to provide you that even if you beg for the most parts. By the time you earn enough its 30 and past gotta marry and a family both work take care of things sleeping would be a vacation.\n\n\nWhat im trying to say most adult indians would have a lack of free capital, lack of expendable time without compromising other things , you've gotta dedicate time for this, while mobile games are quick , prota ble and free to download and play.\n\n\nI have no clue why im typing this nor am i the said things above yet üóø. Im just gonna say im supporting this by commenting and liking this , i won't be able to play this game until i get a pc gaming set up with graphics processing , i just have a asus tuf laptop thats handling current games.

        "text": "As a 3D artist myself I wanted to share few thoughts let me know if they are constructive. \nTo start off, good job with putting the efforts, i think things are in right direction but can be pushed further \nSo, firstly i think it's important to understand what your game is aiming towards gameplay or narrative. Great games have a balance of both but it's subjective at the same time, like detroit is a great narrative based game while doom has crazy good gameplay. So from that point of view I feel the vision is missing from the trailer. Again you can argue we have story through art and have gameplay. But, I think narrative should not be spoonfed to the audience on a primary level it's fine but you can always aim for complexity to get better results. \nMy suggestion talk or hire gameplay designers and narrative designers who have great experience in this domain and have a vision what do you want to showcase. It doesn't have to be rocket science, just proper vision towards the goal. \nSecond, problem with photogrammetry from an artistic standpoint. While it's great that you have used scans to recreate this whole settings, there are few issues with it. 1st you can't use unreals PBR to full potential because most of the data is borrowed from real life and they act as buffer to enhance the artistic aspects. So, in short i think it's important to aim for less is more. \nSecond, there was a wide contrast between the characters the props and environment, from a style pov. Which made things unrelated and inconsistent. \n\nI have showcased artistic feedback later because i understand the technical limitations and this being your first game i understand the sheer ignorance with development you guys will have and its great that you are on this endeavour to push things and our industry i 100% support this thing and looking forward to your progress.\nAnd i believe you man you do listen to your audience, so I hope you go through this feedback too. \n\nHope this helps\nGoodluck üòä",

        "text": "The game looks visually stunning and the gameplay seems quite engaging‚Äîgreat work to the team! üëè However, I‚Äôd like to share a serious concern about the portrayal of the final villain. His appearance, especially with the tilak and vibhuti (sacred ash) on his forehead, strongly resembles that of a Hindu priest or devotee.\n\nI understand the intention might be to depict a Ravana-like character, but in reality, these symbols are worn by countless peaceful and devout Hindus as part of their spiritual practice. Using them to represent evil risks promoting harmful stereotypes.\n\nFrankly, if this were done by someone unfamiliar with Indian culture‚Äîsay, a foreign developer‚Äîit might be seen as ignorance, misunderstanding, or even bias. But when something like this is created by Indians, in India, it becomes deeply disappointing and shameful. Our own creators should know better than to misrepresent sacred traditions for dramatic effect.\n\nI hope future portrayals will handle cultural and religious symbolism more responsibly. Looking forward to seeing how the game evolves.",

BUT HECK! didn't expect a souls like to pop out instead! üî•\nLet me guess, you guys took inspiration from Black myth Wukong, and thought why not represent India in the same way, BUT during the gameplay and (Especially) in audio department I'm smelling a little bit of LIES OF P!! üî• (Anyone else does too?) (One of my most favorite games of all time though, so I was equally shocked and happy when the 'sword clash' sounded pretty familiar! üòÇ) \nThe environment looks Uncharted 4 remastered level (which is amazing!), though the animations sure look ps2 level (no offense, I know it's a very early build), guess it'll take atleast 2 years to polish all that out. üòÖ\nThough, I would really prefer if you take all the time you guys require to polish it like a diamond, instead of hurrying and putting like out all those buggy, glitchy, abominations we were getting from real 3A studios üòÇ.\n\nYou guys are right... If you can pull this off, I can finally see other Indians getting a confidence boost, and who knows, maybe we'll get our own Soul's aside, Wukong or stellar blade by 2030?\n\nI don't know if you guys will read my comment or not, but I'd like to wish you guys all the best from my bottom of my heart!! Please make it awesome!! üî•. \nI'm so excited for this game to succeed, that I'll even try to support through YouTube superchat (Never done before!), when I get my pocket money!\nKeep it up and have a great day! üëç",

        "text": "I see that your game is going towards the \"souls-like\" genre of games with the parrying, rest shrines, bosses and dodging. As a huge fan of souls-like games and having played various top-notch souls like games with probably the hardest difficulties, I want to recommend you a few things which I think will make the game much more souls-like!\n\n1. Textures don't always mean everything! You can have the best graphics in the world but if the gameplay mechanics isn't on-par with the quality then what's the point? A major audience in India don't have very high-spec systems. In fact, I believe most play on laptops or computers they buy for study or college purposes. So please try to optimize the game enough so that it is smooth to run. After all, no souls-like game is enjoyable without a smooth fps.\n\n2. The gameplay mechanics seem pretty lineant and impact-less. I mean, how can one deflect a giant-ass weapon without any struggle? It's as if the deflecting animation has just been copied and pasted everywhere without even tweaking it. Please make the deflection feel as if it packs a punch (like with audio effects, smooth recoil).\n\n3. Some of the gameplay mechanics feel weird. How can one deflect bullets using a wide machete by just parrying it? The running animation feels as if its just been copied from Assassin's Creed. Why would there be a huge-ass \"Sankat\" warning message? Wouldnt it just make seeing the boss's moves harder? Instead why not just give it a small, minimal looking but noticeable skull icon or hindi letter etc (like that of Sekiro). The blood particles or parrying particles feel overly exxagerated. I would advice reducing the density of particles, making the radius smaller and the colour less brighter.\n\n4. The lack of expressions are pretty noticeable. When a policeman notices some criminal, he makes that \"OYE\" or \"IDHAR AA\" expressions i.e the angry/annoyed emotions. The goons should have that cocky, egoistic emotions. The characters mechanics feel choppy and the expressions arent even there when he is choking that enemy in the first scene.\n\n5. The \"activate shrine\" should cause the screen to go dark or some effects other than just idling on the screen. Also, please add some little details like when the big boss hits the ground, his weapon should leave a crater/hole. The HUD feels a bit wide (personal preferrence). You could make it thinner but more longer or minimalistic so that it doesnt interfere with the gameplay. Also, please try to include the beautiful landscapes of India as well and not just those slums or villages. By that I mean, the beautiful mountains or gardens or beaches etc which we have. The UI should be less brighter with the font having a darker coulour. (I feel that the yellow-red background makes the text harder to read in the inventory. Also, please include simpler terms for the various items to be found in the game. (I mean the sankskrit or pure-hindi terms might be hard to understand for the general audience.\n\nAs an Indian, I too feel proud that we are finally venturing into the game-developement space. From one Indian gamer to another, I found it necessary for me to make this comment since I dont want this project to not be excellent after all the hard-work and time you all have spent.",

The difficulty some projects face is that they look great, but don‚Äôt mechanically feel satisfying or innovative, so fingers crossed that you‚Äôre doing extremely extensive play-testing, and letting that feedback guide the tweaking of game mechanics, level design, animation pacing & sound. Especially in the already brimming soulslike/action rpg genre, those seem to be main indicators of international success for titles. Huge respect for taking risks that very few have taken, and congratulations to everyone on the project!",

This could mean they are charging higher rates, akin to international developers.\n\nThe trailer showcases a vibrant Indian gully, but this is not reflected in the gameplay. Perhaps they should ask the 3D modelers to create renders based on references from Chanderi.\n\nThis perception contributes to why some foreigners view us Indians as scammers.",

        "text": "5:30 Starting\r\n\r\nAs the game has maintained such high quality environment and realism in its surroundings I (not speaking for others) personally would expect  to see more things be logical and consistent, Some might say why am I expecting logics in game, games aren't real, things are very much made up in it. Then here is the timestamp 12:30 where Varun himself talks about how they care about little details like window, handle of auto and scooter & so, to fix the imperfections. When such little detail matters then I think battles and interaction of the character with other things should also have same consistency to make sense. I hope this comment is taken as constructive criticism because if devs are talking about quality and perfection I think as a user I have the ability to criticize about it as well.\r\n\r\n6:20 The ground is wet and muddy, how come the character is running on a wet ground making no noise and sneaking up on enemy what sort of stealth is that? It would make more sense if enemy was more aggro and not just walking around with no sense of danger.\r\n\r\n6:45 again if you look at the environment it is very much real looking, but the blood looks totally cartoonish as its some RPG game, painted on top of scene, you can pause your video around this timestamp and see how inconsistent things are.\r\n\r\n8:51 The cutscene, finger of the boss enemy looks like noodles as it has no bones, too long and thin as compared to whole size of the boss enemy itself same for the other side of arm, looks deformed inconsistent size and shape \r\n\r\nOverall the map seems very narrow and small, 5-6 enemy after just few steps in game and then a boss fight?\r\nIf there was even 3-4 lines of story telling it would look and feel much better, hopefully in official teaser things will make more sense.\n\nAnd now some brutal inputs, pehli baat toh I don't understand why all Indian devs or creators khudka product launch karke emotion selling kyu karte hai? Indian culture ko represent karna hai but aisa kya character ko dhoti dediya villains are some ruthless civilians and bad police men? and thoda religious Ramayana or Mahabharat ke story ki touch dedo or emotion selling hojayegi kisi god ke avatar ko showcase kardo kya hai ye sab no matter how high quality the game is made in what's the point of it when the same typical mistake continues which other industries failed to fix as well",

Although the presentation could look more engaging if you have at least two speakers, makes the viewer feel part of the team.\nOne suggestion I have for your team: Take feedbacks with a grain of salt, so many people nag about a lot without understanding market research, what is trending, keywords a user would expect from a premise. E.g. the slums are a unique environment and I knew before clicking that viewers will hate it. It is perfectly fine for an RPG to start with modest levels with modest environments moving to different varied levels. You will also get nostalgia factor from overseas users from the Slumdog millionaire movie.",

Now, I don't know how the final version would be but right now I just don't see much soul into it. Also using Unreal 5 could be a death sentence. It's one of the most unoptimized engine available. Another thing is it being an \"AAA\" title, that already comes with a lot of expectations. That give rise to a lot of worries people should be having. The price, performance, content. Not saying you don't have it figured out but the presentation certainly didn't give me anything to chew on. \n\nYou can very well prove me wrong. But so far it looks soulless, uninspired, buzzword ripoff of a franchise that I personally hold dear to my heart, and it's just not me. Hopefully next time you show the game at least some of my concerns could be proven wrong. Again man, not hating on it but can't just jump into trusting an \"AAA developer\" after everything going on in the industry.\n\nCautiously optimistic though. Next presentation will be telling.",

My only concern is that the gameplay looks janky and you mentioned that it is inspired by sekiro but this in game footage made fights look easy. But in qny case, you have taken up a huge risk and I pray for your success. Many don't realise how big of a leap it is for India as a country nit just for you guys.

        "text": "Amazing effort!!! Although this is a very early build and surely a lot more will be added in the development process, here are some suggestions from me:\n\r\n1.This is a fantasy game, go more artistic with the Lighting. In any fantasy game like Sekiro, Elden ring, God of War, DA Inquisition etc. you will see that they are much more artistic with their lighting choices. That‚Äôs because realistic lighting in fantasy games may look a little out of place. A more stylized lighting can make the visuals more appealing.\n\r\n2.Blood splatters too far from where the impact is happening then vanishes in thin air. If there is blood, the blood should stain the clothes and skin, as well as fall on the ground and splash on the walls. If blood stains the weapon, make the character wipe off the blood as blood is highly corrosive to metal. Little details go a long way. Take inspiration from Ghost of Tsushima‚Äôs bloody combat.\n\r\n3.When the player is walking there is no visual cue. If it is a muddy ground, there should be footprints, if not footprints then at least make little splashes of water. If the ground is dry, there can be a little dust whenever the foot hits the ground. Different games do it in different ways. Some kind of visual sensation will surely make the movement of the player feel better.\n\r\n4.The boss is yelling, but his mouth is visibly closed at all times, looks odd. You can either animate the face with the sound or play with the lighting and headgear to subtly hide the face during the battle. Sekiro does both with different bosses.",

Add temples/mandirs instead, see ? Some simple tweeks here and there would solve the problems but those tweask should be innovative or creative imo.\n2. Dont make the combat souls like if that was your vision initially or is now after i have seen everyone sayin the enemies should be aggressive or something.yess the enemies should be aggressive but the gameplay shouldnt be relying on fast movements like sekiro but a mix of gameplay complexities and fast movement. By gameplay complexity i mean rpg elements that enhances your character in unique ways. Keep it balanced for a engaging yet challanging combat. Gameplay>>> graphics just dont try to make this a souls like pls \n3. Doesn't matter if the game is of 20 hours or 10 but dont make the things repetitive. Always keep adding new things as the game progresses and not the in the spoon feeding way but keep it just this much open so it allows a sense of discovery, kind of like botw tofk. Actually it would be very fun and interesting to have a botw tofk kinda game from india that doesnt go flashy with being a aaa game but just stays fun, engaging yet challenging.

You have to do that with not just the story but visually too.\n\nImagine a game like god of war, but instead of being set in ancient Greece, it is set in slums of Mumbai with \"bollywood\" twist.\n\nEvery once in a while there is a game maker in India who try to make a \"game set in India\" and not a game. Don't fall into same trap.\n\nSure assets are good, may be mechanics are good to but you want to tell a story inspired of Ramayan, set in a slum, there is a guy with a sword dressed out of time, there is police in uniform and guns, a guy in safari with pipe, a giant south Indian with a mace, \"bollywood\" style and everything looks a mess. Is it similar to some places in India? Yes. But it looks like a place most people would not like to be in. \n\nMake something beautiful not realistic.

        "author": "@Future_Guy",
        "text": "Disclaimer: I am exhausted by looking at the existing state of the Indian gaming industry and most of my opinions have been negative with respect to the approach most Indian developers take. So whatever I say below is coming from this existing lens. Positive and negative. (And I see there's 4K+ comments, maybe something will get repeated from those.) I am a developer myself so I am 100% into the know how. I am not a bystander commenting on something I know nothing about. Here goes -- \n\nSet Design - I've seen a couple of AAA games in development who've released their trailers/teasers and one thing common across them is the incredible set design. I absolutely LOVE how the environments end up looking. Photo-realism is not my first thought but many (including you) have managed to get that. Scanning is obviously an incredible technological marvel and with a lower entry bar I am glad that developers are utilizing it to it's full potential. I like your approach with the creation of the rig to scan clothes and everything else. Perfect Indian jugaad indeed. I will add one point here which is scanning the mannequins in a T-pose. \n\nAnimations - It is indeed a lot of effort. I highly commend all the hours your team has put into this. MY problem however is that MoCap to Gameplay transition has to be a lot more seamless. There's a high level of detail that seems to be missing. The fights that happen is where it is apparent. The attacks don't connect naturally. There's a lot of force that is missing. It feels like dandiya. Also, the facial features were missing but this is only a problem since you've added faces! Most games create face masks or really twisted faces so that the connect with realism goes away. Objective here is to immerse the player with the fight. I look at the policeman with this wide eyes and I am immediately out of the zone. (This is also more of a industry wide issue. There is the \"uncanny valley\" effect. The player will never be able to pinpoint what exactly is off but they will always feel it.)\n\nGameplay - There is a rule that the first 2 minutes of the game should be exciting enough for the player to continue playing. You're yet to achieve that. FTUE is what matters. I've played over 200 games until now and I regularly play games after work (yes, sad I know). Valve does this very well. They have perfected the art of introducing gameplay through a very naturally occuring curve. For example, they will introduce the first enemy in an environment where it cannot reach the player thereby ensuring that the player is safe. Also provide them with a weapon that they can practice with how many times ever they want. Half Life Alyx did that with a gun and unlimited bullets. Half Life 2 did that with the saw blade. Portal does that the first time they introduce the turrets. It's fantastic and it ALWAYS works. Upon watching the gameplay here it just felt like what the hell is this guy? Why does he have a sword? Why is he attacking policemen? There is a disconnect right of the bat. For me at least. \n\nEnemies - You said that you're trying to create a bollywood style game. Can you please not? I really beg of you to not aim for that. Movies are not games. Games are not movies. There is an inherent difference in the larger than life sequences in movies that we prefer to watch but if that takes you out of the gameplay, then is it worth it? I really like the last enemy but the previous ones were very mediocre. And I absolutely hated the small clip of the hero running his hands on his hair. It was very tacky. UNLESS you are targetting a particular type of audience, this is not what the masses want. DMC (Devil May Cry) has such animations as well but they feel good because of the lineage they have created with their games. The first DMC wasn't made with that intention but now they have a lot of story and lore to support it. This hero here, is a nobody now. \n\nStory - This is a very common thing that almost all the big games that came out did. They ALWAYS target Mythology. Main reason being that you don't have to write a story. It already exists. I personally am not a fan of this trope. It is very low effort but there are outliers. Look at Raji and Asura. Both amazing games that utilize Indian mythology in a very unique manner. Here, I feel like you're going for a story where the hero can tap into the powers of Vishnu's Avatars? In the teaser he is tapping into Krishna it seems. The other games coming out are targetting Indian mythos or history. I am not a fan but hopefully you will do justice with it. \n\nConclusion - I don't think I have seen a YouTuber get into Gaming before (in India) and I hope you are getting into this with the right mindset. You might be concentrating more on realistic set design now but it is a step that should be taken after making more gameplay. Please look at some dev diaries of Valve games or Ubisoft games or any other studio. Better gameplay ensures better player feel. The environments are visible for a few seconds. They are not the focus. I don't look at the foliage ALL the time in Sekiro or the amazing levels of Uncharted! I look at it once and it's gone the moment I am out of that area. I am not going to look at the way the rickshaw looks or the Tomato lorry looks for more than 10 seconds. But what am I doing 90% of the time? Controlling the character. I constantly look at the hero animating with respect to teh environment or enemies. \n\nI hope you get something useful out of this. I could talk so much more about this. I honestly love games and seeing you make this makes me feel so proud. I just want it to be done well. Good luck! :)",

Visually this is great, better than anything that has come from India, but you can work on audio, using amazing bgms, getting voice actors (or good AI voiceovers) for every enemy and some good ambient sounds.\n2. The animations can be a smoother for every character.\n3. The attacks look great but the damage it is doing is not translated somehow.\n4. This is purely developers choice but if we can see some dismemberment for the enemies it will just elevate the experience.\n5. And most importantly visually you have won half the battle, but please have a great story so that this can blow up like wukong did.\n\nThats just some suggestions but what this looks as pre alpha is mind blowing, kudos and All the best to you guys.\nPS : launch it for PS and Xbox too",

I mean at the start of the trailer, listen carefully. Also, the idea of using a temple-like structure at the middle of the street is... It kinda rings the bells from Black myth wukong, and not gonna lie, this game looks to be a recreated version of Black myth wukong. It would be appreciated if you were able to match the industry standard quality without rushing and having an actual big team of 150-200 people (it may sound a lot, but it's normal for AAA studios. While games like Black myth wukong and Detroit become human got 140-150 people, BOTW, Elden Ring, and many other AAA catagory games with high quality graphics had a team of around 300 people or even more than that. Gta 5 and RE8 had over a 1000 people).\n\nBtw, really admire the idea of retelling the entire story of Ramayan via this game and it will be appreciated to continue with the project.

My main problem is with what i can see of the current combat system and enemy AI. the sword fights feel rigid and snappy (not in a good way), im kind of looking for something similar to ghost of tsushima. The enemies just looking on as you kill their buddies? lore accurate as far as bollywood goes but not exactly a fun or challenging scenario. \n\nthe artwork looks amazing btw!",

        "text": "Great work done by the team! But why does some of it feel like Sekiro? Though it's the alpha build, animations and combat mechanics can be much better. You have the time, please focus on improving the game mechanics and story more than just the graphics. Also judging from the graphics (with probably further enhancements in the future) it looks like this game would be heavy hardware demanding (maybe RTX 40 or 50 series GPUs at bare minimum). Please optimize the game so that a large number of players with mid range rigs can also get interested in buying and playing the game. \n\nGames like black myth wukong are kinda play once type of game because their only objective is to deliver an immersive story. UTA's development should also be more biased towards the story imo so that it becomes a successful launch.\n\nPlease consider this as a small piece of suggestion from a gamer's end. Rooting for UTA's success!!",

Attack feels hollow, it needs to have a bit more animation. You can shake the camera a bit more dramatically for that especially the attacks after parrying.\n3. Enviroment is too small. I think some bigger games had this issue in past and it almost killed that game so Make your environment big so people don't feel like they are constrained.\n4. Same with boss, the aftereffects of his attack were good but he heavily lacked variety and also his attacks when it hit the character were lackluster. Also every enemy of yours felt slow in movement. \n\nSince its alpha build, I hope you take these into consideration. Good luck",

So kudos for that. \r\nBut if you want some constructive criticism, here it is. \r\n\r\nThat small mandir has kachra in front of it. I know we have a waste problem in India, but I have never seen a temple or smaller shrines surrounded by waste. Maybe it is just me, but that was my immediate response. \r\nAs you say, Bollywood style, it really feels like that because one policeman has a laathi(maybe a constable?) while the other has a gun, but even after that, he is not shooting. But later he shoots, and our hero is miraculously safe since Goli hit the talwar, no goli ka charra, nothing.\r\nAlso, in Kshudita Asura, his foot is in a puddle, but the water doesn't have any effect most of the time, except for one time. When the hero hits him, there are no after effects like Kapde katna and all.\r\nI know some of these are very minute things. But, there are so many things I can point out that will ruin the experience of gaming while playing, because these things subconsciously affect the whole experience.\r\n\r\nAlso, since you guys used Hindi fonts sometimes, like SANKAT, if someone doesn't know Hindi, how will they know what is written? Is there any option for language? \r\n\r\nI hope you read this and think about it. I really want this game to be successful. All the very best.",

When a wooden stick collides with a steel sword, the sound effect currently resembles the sound of two steel swords striking each other. This doesn‚Äôt reflect the expected material interaction and slightly breaks the immersion during gameplay.\n\nAs an experienced game tester with 4.8 years of experience including testing AAA titles, mobile games, and PC/cloud-based games I‚Äôve seen how much of a difference accurate sound design can make to the overall feel of a game. \n\nI just wanted to highlight this as part of helpful feedback.

That‚Äôs why fun should be the foundation ‚Äî not comparison.\n\nHonestly, most gamers don‚Äôt care about how big your team is, what engine you‚Äôre using, or if it‚Äôs 'India‚Äôs first this or that.' We care if it‚Äôs engaging, satisfying, and worth our time. That‚Äôs what matters.\n\nI‚Äôm saying this as someone who wants to see great games come out of India. Not just good-looking ones ‚Äî great ones. If the vision gets lost in comparisons and marketing hype, the game might look polished, but won‚Äôt leave a mark.\n\nSo please ‚Äî stay true to your vision. Don‚Äôt build a game to prove a point. Build it to make people feel something. If you do that, success will follow, no matter the genre, platform, or budget.\n\nREMEBER = Gamers do not remember budget, THEY REMEMBER MOMENTS!!!\n\nEdit - my previous comment tone was harsh and too blunt, that's why I used AI",

He is very agile and his leg movement and placements are really good. Thats will make a fluid character movement. \n\nSuggestions:\n1. You can change the color grading of the game. its feeling dull.\n2. The space is too small for the protagonist to fight since he is using a sword. He needs a wider pathe to dodge and counter (Refer dmc, sekiro, souls games, prince of persia warrior within)\n3. Stick to 1 style of play since it seems a linear gameplay rather open world. Since the gameplay showcase the stealth takedown then sword to sword and sword to gun play. It will complicate development plans and also for the users gameplay. Need a core gameplay mechanics ( eg. Splinter cell, soldier elite 2, mad payne)\n4. Can reduce the high quality assets that represent the realtime objects. It will create compatibility issues in many pc due to optimisation. Changing the art design will help a lot. (E.g dishonored, the lost crown, ryse son of rome)\n\nThats it!\n\nLove to see the game after completion üéâ",

A souls like game would can become popular very easily as the story is not the main selling point of the game, its the difficulty. Also you'll be able to save money on story and script writing and can very easily take a iterative development approach where you make one boss and immediately give it your testers. No linking stories between levels. \n\nWorld looks absolutely gorgeous right now, basically the other thing that is in a typical souls game. So you'll be able to pretty much play into your exisiting game. Remove any cops or npcs that look out of place, either everyone has a gun or no one. Bringing a sword to a gun fight wont fly with critics (also using indian cops can get your game banned pretty quick).\n\nI would love that you have a more dark and gritty world surroundings and use indian mythological demons as bosses. That would be so damn cool. \n\nNontheless game looks great for alpha, gorgeous world",

The script, narration, gameplay, BGM everything. I just want to help you here because there are a lot of people who want to become a part of this industry but it's very difficult in India. I would request you to take time, roll out an alpha, get some feedback and refine. This is not going to be easy for sure but I want to wish you all the best for this!\n\nEdit:\nI don't know whether you've seen SIFU. It's a fairly small game but the gameplay, mechanism, combat, story is top-notch. Please have a look",

        "text": "It is great that someone is doing something from India, but this is not high quality at all. The foliage comes off as a bit unrealistic because the artist used assets from Megascan without considering where each plant fits best, making it feel a bit disconnected. Some realistic, hand-painted foliage could bring it to life! Also, the character movements in combat could use some tweaking. The lack of eye movement and facial expressions makes them feel less engaging. Plus, the hair design seems to need some improvement, and it‚Äôs a little odd to see characters floating and not having any footprints. I am not against it, but it looks like a bunch of rookies created it because there are so many problems. In the end, I hope they fix all the mistakes and create a better game.",

With all due respect, what you have done is mindblowing and take courage to even execute.\n\nWhat the game needs a bit more is dynamic and object colisions.\n\nSmall details like footprints and wet ground affecting the surrounding.\n\nFacial expressions is something that if done perfectly, will show results and build more depth.\n\nEven while in combact, the protagonist should react differently for every attack type and not just parry without any blow backwards.\n\nFluidity in combat is also a crucial thing in games, understanding that this is the first build, you will improve things and well all know how much of a passion you can put in these projects.\n\nThese things can be ironed out by just in a few months of more work but this will be the last stretch for the development \n\nPlaytest game and try to find actual gamers to play this game and give you their honest review before launch as a Playtest because thats where small things miss and leave a bad taste\nAnd a game of this Calibre, you have literally a lot to manage and little to no leg room for errors\n\nBut one thing is for sure, You can take your time to make things so perfect that no one will be able to find mistakes in this game.\n\n\nAnd i know you know this as well because you made the game. \n\nPeople will compare this to other AAA games and its an Uphill battle for you to make 'OUR' game Worthy for world wide recognition.\n\nYou have My wishes and i would buy this game.",

Games like dota, WOW are cult classic(not India, cuz we don't have true gamers) not becoz of graphics. Gameplay matters the most, will it be story based? Online? different costumes and weapons? Character specifications? Etc\n\nStoryline is something, i also agree with, something unique. Unfortunately India doesn't have good authors, maybe only malayalee(they are too focused on writing non-fiction) and bengali(not much) authors are writing some good stories, rest are slum fetishes, Wattpad smutt or Hindu tales recopying\n\nIn modern times, how many original superheroes can you name from India??(Like america it japan has) How many indian authors have you read with its own world building, characters etc, like transformers, Harry porter, DBZ, Pokemon. How many indian authors have explored space?? Like dune, star wars. How many indian authors have explored cyberpunk stories like cowboy bepop, tron, akira etc\nIndian authors lack creativity for now, i hope they explore such topics, they should not focus \nWe need innovative people who develop such stories, no need of it being indian centric. Most japanese anime like Pokemon, akira, mushoku tensei are not based on India.",

        "text": "Congratulations! And I am really proud that we have real problem solvers in the Indian gaming scene! Having a small team of 40 young artists and building something of this scale must have taken a lot of effort!\n\nHowever, I have some feedback and early criticism based on the small fraction of gameplay shown of the game in alpha stage.\n\n1. Artistic distinction: Unreal engine was the right choice because of its pricing structure, but it has a generic look to it. It was evident in the gameplay without the unreal engine splash screen. Having a small team is tough but I feel like it has a big advantage of having the opportunity to have artistic distinction. The engine is great at achieving cheap realism, but there is opportunity to do more with less. Unreal has a huge library of scans and doing your own to match those feels like going forward resources and time can be better utilised.\nAnother thing is eye candy. There is a huge opportunity to celebrate Indian colours, the game currently seems to lack exactly that. The Avatar transformation at the end gave me goosebumps, majorly being a great scene but also because thats the first time it felt like the game had Indian colours! Real life is boring, games have the opportunity to exaggerate life and be fun!\n\n2. Visual fidelity: It was brave incorporating 3D scans of real places in the game and they are awesome! However, it feels like there is a mismatch between the high fidelity massive environment and low fidelity NPCs (protagonist though, really really great!). Also, many textures are a bit too high resolution like the side walls in contrast to low texture mud and grass right next to it making it visually jarring. Maybe in the beta stage of the game you can even them out. Also scanning every material makes it boring, for example, the metal sheets and the plastic covers and the walls of huts and sheds all have the same texture! Since Unreal engine has great materials readily available, maybe mixing and matching your scans with sprinkle of different textures would be amazing!\n\n3. Scattered focus: I suggest that it would be great if shortcuts are taken in the upcoming developments in the environment, having intentional focus only on monuments and objects the director feels important for the plot. Everything being equally crisp, bright and in focus gives the initial awe feeling but eventually makes it hard to focus on the things that actually matter.\nFor example, the dense buildings in the distance may be reduced with cheap haze/fog giving it a sense of volume but not taking away the focus of the player. The shrine may have visual cues, or maybe distinctly have bright texture while the background may have muddy textures, so that the shrine pops.\n\n4. Stage building (?): I assume the game has a linear plot and it is not an open world game but it doesn't have to have extremely linear paths. From the players perspective holding W or thumb stick up all the time can be very boring and tiring! Random turns, corners and some dead ends, not having enemies in direct sight all the way to the end of the path would be amazing and may feel more interactive!\n\n5. Character: In the current state, the characters feel a little less alive. Rigging faces of every character is hard, but I hope at least eyes of major enemies during special attacks could move to show some emotions and not be robotic. At least protagonist should definitely have some expressions especially because there are closeups. And definitely distinct voice for the protagonist, during actions, attacks and other engagements it would be nice to have the character making noises. \n\nI think the efforts need to be directed to game direction than making the game look extremely good like a tech demo, but then what do I know about game production hahah! But often there are ground breaking games built solo or by a team of 2-4 people. Concepts and direction go a long way!\n\nWhat I love about the game is how its paving way for itself. I really really want it to succeed, its like my own dream is coming to life! All the best wishes and looking forward to a finished game! I will definitely buy the game!",

From the starting only under the torso or the main character you can see his dhoti was getting glitched with his legs, hope you'll fix it!\n2. The interaction with NPC, means when the Character hit them is not at all good, especially notice the 1st one with the woman 6:28 and even the portion where sword meets hand (IDK the exact term for this) but this all needs improvement very much and every serious gamer notices this, same issue here 8:52\n3. The movement mechanics seem good but can be improved, take some inspiration from Sekiro!\n4. When characters/NPCs walk over mud there should be some splashes, their foot becoming dirty and all. \n\n\n\n\nBTW overall it was really good and please consider the above flaws in gameplay, take time guys, best wishes with you ‚ù§‚ù§",

Anyone with bare minumum knowledge of unreal engine can cook up a scene like this in less than a week. Visuals amount to nothing without a good story, mechanics, combat and sound design among other things. People should stop unnecessarily hyping this game by comparing it with games that took years to master. Indian games will always fail if you set the bar this high. Like someone else pointed out, I want to see Indian studios making Indie games like, inside, hades, dead cells, hollow knight or even blasphemous.

SInce this is an alpha build , i really hope they can get people to test the game, fix some of the issues that i mentioned above and improve based on feedback. And while fall 2026 seems like a bit of an early release date considering how many things can be improved, i am really hoping they are able to deliver a product that is polished and well made. Kudos to the development team again, I hope you become the pride of Indian game development and put India on par with other industry giants in the space. I am rooting for you!!",

The fundamental of game is gameplay. And honestly the gameplay is garbage here. You can optimise the game for the year to increase the framerates.. but the actuall gameplay look is so uninspiring, very bare bones. You are just banking on it to look good thanks to UE, but for it to have world class standards there should have been more focus on GAMEPLAY!!",

And how it‚Äôs different from any other first-person game? To me, it just felt like Indianising a gameplay format, and I really don't understand why the hero is ki*ling the police and native people or a \"Gunda\". And one big justifying question I wanted to ask is, were you trying to gamify a story through building a gameplay so that the world gets to know about the history of India or wanted to explore the technical and software and building part of the game, and you used the story to support your game because I see a disconnect between the two because you talked a lot about technical stuffs but barely about the concept and your motivation to make the game possible other than setting up a world standard. And I would be more than excited to know from you how the game took its shape. \nA small intro of mine, Hi, I am Saket, and I am a student of Design, a Communication Designer from NID who understands all the parameters you discussed in your video, including the concept building part.",

Yes some polishing can be done but lets ot talk about it. And i am assuming you got the Shrine and the over the top dodging animation from BMW and i really like it but the only problem that i can see with what we've seen till now is that the combat isnt as interesting... Sure the system itself is from sekiro but the combat moveset seems sluggish and limited. Thats all i can say about the GamePlay and combat based on what we've seen.\n\nNPCs: They look uncanny and very off, i would suggest looking into Yakuza Games and how they do it.\n\nStory: Since youve kept the story a secret i cannt judge the footage from it but all i can say is, citing Hollow Knight's Gametester \"everything needs to fit in the world, nothing should feel out of place.\" and i stand by this golden rule and this raises lots of questions in my mind. Why is the mc dressed like that? Why is the starting area is mumbai slums? why does the main character have an anciant sword while everyone else is using things similar to danda? Why are we fighting priests in the SLUMS? Why are we killing normal residents? why are the police involved? I would love the story to answer these questions and raise more!\n\nMusic: Pretty good! cant say further due to limited footage\n\nAaand thats it! Thats all what i have to say about the current state of the game that has been released to public. I am really looking forward to what comes next and making our nation stand out (in a +ve way ) in the video game feild :D\n\n- Arrsh",

Fighting could be more of beating than killing and also make the cuts and punches put dirt and blood on clothes make it so how u cut enemy that type clothes tear and bloody cuts, if possible, person get affected if leg is cut, they have hard time standing walking etc.\n\n4. I would buy it is like Prince of Persia rather than Mumbai gallies or GTA.\n\n5. Take your time make bigger and high-quality team, Use AI if it helps use some kind of small LLM model to maybe make NPCs voice lines so they feel natural.\n\n6. Make those drums separate object with physics rather than stuck to the environment make almost everything to be immediately swapped with actual object if it's interacted with.\n\n\nIf all those points are checked and more dynamics environment this game will not just match international AAA standards but surpass in most cases.",

But man, a game of this quality being built in India‚Ä¶ this just brings tears in my eyes. I am super happy of whatever you and your team is doing. Best of Luck to you, your brother Rohan who is leading this, and the entire AEOS Team working 24x7 on this. See you in Future üéØüíñ",

The faces in the game are close to it also I have noticed there are no facial movement or expressions. The animation where the main character brushes his hair is awful. Animate th hair please. \r\n\r\n3.Price: As you know India is a price sensitive market as a broke colledge student who loves games I will come cleanand admit that piracy is the only way I can afford to continue my passion. Make sure that it is not over 400/-\r\n\r\n4.Game design: You know it. I know it. And my dogs also know it. You copied/took inspiration from fromsoftware. I understand even Wukong did it but please add something new to it. Im jus ranting so take it with a grain of salt. THE SHRINE SYSTEM AND GRACE SYSTEM IN ELDEN RING IS LITTERALY THE SAME.

I was expecting something like Balatro or Undertale or Venba.. then i realized that high quality game for most Indians means high graphics.. anyway who cares how a game succeeds.. amirite\n\nhere are my thoughts (as a gamedev) :\n1. nice use of photogrammetry.. I wonder how much of it was done through that.. because I see a lot of such meshes 6:44 (the windows on the right end have leaking textures) but yeah only Unreal can handle such meshes through nanite.. The barricade is def not photogrammetry (and by that I mean 3D scanned meshes, if anyone who is curious, please look up tools like Reality Capture.. basically it takes a shit ton of photos and gives out a 3d model..)\n2. combat looks nice but at 8:04 there's no impact on the player's model.. that would feel a bit more realistic.. and a minor fix- the boss is hovering on the ground at 8:20 .. the collider might be off.. also blood fx look kinda outdated..\n3. character transformation vfx were great at the end.. \nalso careful with accidentally showing brands 7:42 unless Hero is like a partner.. idk..\nbut will it be a good game? depends on what will be added.. because all I see nowadays are Indian versions of Ghost of Tsushima, Black Myth Wukong and GTA but there's not much difference from their 'inspiration'.. I wish lesser demos are made and more games are released.. because the whole character transformation scene could've taken a lot of effort which doesn't really translate into the whole gameplay? maybe one cutscene but yeah, fall 2026 is too early for a game like this imho.. so that's implying somewhere around 16 months of development.. 2 times the effort that was put into the game in it's current state.. do you think the gameplay would be more than an hour?\njust some questions to know answers to for the success of the game...",

Don't know the story yet, but I have so many questions like why is the character \"killling\", not beating up, killing people. Why are cops being killed, what's the basis of the powers and everything invloved.\nI know it's pre-alpha, these things don't matter yet, the game looks absolutely amazing for pre-alpha actually, nearing completion by those standards. But make sure to have a decent amount of depth in the game, maybe normalise these supernatural powers so that even the thugs have powers of some kind, it also keeps a progression system in sight and keeps it sensible.\nTLDR: Make it make sense, focus on the depth factors like worldbuilding, story, gameplay and how they influence and intertwine with each other.",

But here's my take - there are many ambitious projects out there - many of which showcase a small scale demo with high quality graphics with hopes of releasing a full project that delivers. But reality is that graphics is never the only thing that gamers seek. What sticks with gamers is art style, gameplay, story and anything with a lasting impression. Gamers know that indie can excel well beyond AAAs if done right. You don't need realistic - Unreal Engine - esq graphics for that. I would love for India to succeed, I strongly believe we have the talent for it. I also strongly believe that effort and money should be spent well. You are in the best position to determine that. My opinion would be to draw in more inspiration from successful indie projects. Also - do not claim \"High quality\", let the product speak for itself.",

I can only imagine how much time, dedication, and resources it takes to bring a world like this to life. Visually, the game looks absolutely stunning, and the world you've created feels rich and immersive ‚Äî that‚Äôs no small feat.\n\nThat said, I wanted to share some honest feedback. While the visuals and setting are impressive, the gameplay footage didn‚Äôt quite resonate with me. It felt a bit disconnected and somewhat lacking in coherence ‚Äî for instance, seeing a sword-wielding character go up against a police officer with a gun came across as a bit random and mismatched. This contrast made the gameplay feel a bit silly and hard to take seriously, which might affect how players connect with the overall experience.\n\nI truly believe that gameplay is the heart of any great game, and if the mechanics and tone don‚Äôt align with the world you've built, it can be difficult for players to fully immerse themselves. Also the Character models didn't seem right. I hope you and your team take the time to refine and polish the core experience, because there‚Äôs so much potential here. With the right tweaks, this could become something truly special.\n\nWishing you and your team all the very best in the rest of the development process ‚Äî I‚Äôm rooting for you and looking forward to seeing how the game evolves!\n\n[ also it would be nice to get a heart from you to know it read this post ]",

As a senior AAA game artist, I truly appreciate the effort put into the project. That said, I believe there are areas where things could be improved with a bit more finesse.\n\nMany of the scenes and levels currently feel a bit flat, and a lot of the props seem to have excessive roughness. While the depiction of Mumbai's slum areas is impressive, the placement of grass and small plants‚Äîlikely from Megascans‚Äîfeels random in some spots. In reality, due to space constraints in such areas, vegetation is often much more sparse or selectively present, which isn‚Äôt reflected well in the level design.\n\nWith Unreal‚Äôs latest features like displacement and Nanite, there‚Äôs a lot of potential to enhance both performance and visual quality. As you have a great team that has worked on amazing titles and movie projects, I‚Äôd love to see their skills utilized in even smarter and more creative ways moving forward.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt meant as a criticism but rather a suggestion from someone who‚Äôs passionate about quality and authenticity in game environments.

The story that I can predict about this game is maybe a vigilante from the slum trying to fight a mafia boss in the Mumbai , almost every other Indian game tries to do this . \nThe best Indian game ever were Kali , Fears of Fathom etc . They were unique and implementation was top notch .\nBut still I might be wrong lets wait for the final gameplay",

It's just my inner thaught.\n\nWhy do all studios that are making Indian games shows the game is located in a slum location???? Do you think China don't have slums?? U think China don't have poor people??? Have you seen the rural part of china, that worse than Indian Rural areas. But the Chinese government is so smart that they always hide it from the world and portray the nice image of China they want us to see by their propoganda. That's why when a chinese studio decided to make a game they made Blackmyth Wukong, to show the good part Chinese culture. But somehow our Indian studios are stuck at showing like our culture is all about living in slums ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. China actively blocks content that will rune it's reputation, like not showing it's countryside, their Food Hygiene problems (Gutter oil), eating random animals, poor tofu construction buildings. And only allow to show flashy things but in India our food vlogers deliberately made those dirty stree food video famous. Things that made even most Indians shocked, but well done üëç, now it's our image in front of the world. \n\nI'm not saying India should also spread propoganda like China, sensor evrything, isolate the internet from world, spy on it's citizens. But I don't know how slums became part of our identity ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è when most if the people don't even live in slums. Future developers and directors should consider it while producing media. There should be media made to criticize the wrong things in our society but it's like we are glorifying something that is nothing to be proud about",

        "text": "Idk if you'll see the comment, but this comment includes 2 pieces of feedback that I believe will help make things better!\n\nThis looks pretty good for Alpha! I am a gamer myself, who also happens to be into CS, AI and Computer Vision, but I also love gaming, so I have played a lot of games so far. One thing I focus a lot on is the feel of the gameplay, the animations and the plot. \n\nThere is ONE feedback I'd like to give in that regard:\n07:06 Here, when I see the buildup to the finisher animation, I predict a piercing strike coming. Like when the character charges the blade behind, it seems as if he's readying a piercing move, shoving the blade up the enemy's stomach/chest, something like that. But it AWKWARDLY cuts in this cross slash animation, which really doesn't connect well with the ramp up. Assuming this is the way you intended things to be, it's not a good finisher animation. \n\nApart from this, I don't see any glaring issues for an Alpha build. I'd honestly love to give more feedback as well, because as I said again, I love gaming as a hobby on the side, a passionate hobby you could say. Some of the movement animations look janky, but that's to expected from an alpha build. Hope to see more refinement in the finer details of the game!\n\nEDIT: Another feedback:\n08:27 Here, it seems like this is a perfect dodge? It's a cool animation, but adding a bit more of post processing effects and visual FX might help actually accentuate the impact of the perfect dodge. The SFX for it is good, but the visuals would need some touch up. Just giving my 2 cents for these 2 things I noticed, so the final version can be touched up accordingly!",

While the scans and backgrounds are amazing, and you take a lot of pride in it and spend a lot of time talking about it, photorealistic graphics don't make a game. A game needs to be fun first and foremost. And currently, the gameplay shown just looked like a worse version of Sekiro and other similar games. I wish you showed off what makes your game actually unqiue - the Avatar (religious) aspect with the transformation. You should have actually showed that part so we can see what makes your game unique. What you showed off, unfortunately, is just a worse version of existing game mechanics and doesn't look high quality at all.\n\nI know the game isn't finished, but especially because it is not done, it is more important to showcase why your game is special. People know things can be improved, but people only buy new games if they offer something different than the existing ones.",

This looks like very bad version of any Souls game. I am not going to praise this I am sorry but this ain't it and you are NOT going to set any standards with this the Combat was VERY basic and NOT fun at all for a fun combat example please look at recent titles like \"Khazan The First Berserker\" And Monster Hunter Wilds. \n\nI know these are very high budget titles and a YouTuber can't afford something like this but I would suggest you create very fun gameplay oriented game because if we are weak at graphics and character building, story building and many others things that we indians lacks in we can excel in one thing inside gaming industry by creating actual fun games. \n\nWhat's a fun game? It's very subjective but the genre you chose the fun is defined by boss fights combats and of course we haven't seen the magic part of this game yet but by animations of character movements I can say it is not going to be good. \n\nI suggest you look at old school Nintendo games, Java phone games and many famous titles draw a architecture of it hire a Psychologist tell him to find you a sweet spot display a cinematic trailer and then decide on development. \n\nThe D riding in the comments is crazy either you guys don't understand what a good game looks like or you are just d riding like you all do in all comments. Please be honest to our community don't say nice things give them constructive criticism no one is perfect everybody learns everyday and we should give then honest feedback so create the best. \n\nThat's all best of luck on whatever you decide‚ù§",

(Unless ofcourse this isn't an open world in which case your story will be the most important thing with gameplay)\n\nYou cannot just get away with good looking world in a game, it has to have a immersive gameplay and not static with 10/10 story that actually excites you to play more. \nIf the story is just about Hinduism and you wish to ride a wave of \"Hindu ya religion p video bana lo and paisa hi paisa\" then you'll have a lot of Downloads but not many returning players.",

I should say you did a great job. however i think you missed the oppurtinity of using the particle system. it should work great with the magical theme. and second photoscans are good for background assets, they can generate great geometry but when it comes to textures is sucks. it bakes things like ao in them which makes it look like they dont belong in the environment. A much better solution would have been to use the 3d scans as a refrence point and build new geometry on top of it and make custom pbr materials. cuz your 3d scans dont change lighting, reflections based on lighting and stuff. they look off. they look blurry as compared to the game also really bad at closeups. last but not least everything feels clunky like using assets and systems from fab. its not wrong but they need polishing. mainly the movement system. the environment dosent seem to react to the player much. its like a completely different set piece like footprints and stuff. the characters scale fells off as one cop is smaller than the mc. I really appreciate the work you put into this but it needs polishing and the decisign to use photoscan directly a bad idea. and as for 100% in engine screenshot well they are not cuz the lighting dosent effect the assets they are not pbr they are just base color textures slapped on them. they will look smae even withouting any shadows and lighting change. As for global benchmark well not really. this game really needs polish. and a tone to work with",

Please have a nice story, the story is something that will either make the game go boom, or go doom.\n2. Well to be on a safer side, make the \"asuras\" actually look like \"asuras\" instead of priests. You see the asura looked more like a priest that was in a giant form instead of asura. As it's still in development, you can fix all these issues to avoid any controversies and all.\n3. Also when designing a asura you will still get many more liberties and you can make them look cooler with magic and all.\n\nThese are just constructive criticism for the game, and i really want that this goes international like black myth, i wish you all the best, please take the criticisms positively. Really appreciate the hardwork!!",

And a necessary one.\n\nWhat you and the team are doing ‚Äî building a AAA-quality game rooted in Indian culture, mythology, and design ‚Äî is brave, beautiful, and deeply important.

In the caution, the doubt, the deference.\n\nAnd over time, it dims our confidence. It shapes how we see ourselves. It makes us timid in our dreams and hesitant in our ambitions.

Dynamic displacement mapping, maybe even using decals can also add into the realism! For puddles, if you add screen space effects like splashing when moving over them can also greatly improve the experience. Finally, render resolution seemed a bit low (looking at the artifacts near the hair), along with lower quality textures! \nBut having said all this, even though it is not exactly AAA title according to global standards today, but it's quite close to it, and some adjustments can really push this game to that level where your vision of creating a world class game where people won't be able to tell where it is from (excluding the story), can really come to life!\nFrom a former amateur cry-engine game dev and a gamer with 17+ years of experience playing games :p\nWish you all the very best! Hopefully this reaches the AAA quality and you achieve what you've been dreaming!",

Please take it as constructive criticism - \n\n- Background looks good, but rest of the element of the game feels a bit undercooked. \n- A Good game requires a satisfying core game loop and in-depth game mechanics. You complement those game mechanics with beautiful graphics. Not other way around. So, in a production pipeline of 8 months, graphics should not be a priority instead game design is first thing you need to get right. Get an experienced Game designer.\n- Background music is awesome.\n- I would recommend get a Narrative designer on the team. They will help you blend your story to the game. \n- Also Get a combat designer, to make the combat satisfying.\n- Need more work on gamefeel.\n\nOverall, feels more of a tech demo than a game.  Good wishes, please keep up the good work, eventually you will get there.",

        "text": "This is a fantastic effort from India in gaming space.  But for someone who enjoyed gaming thanks to Roadrash and GTA - I have few pointers which you can work upon, because you are still in building phase and can make the product changes. If you are looking for a rational QA, I can help.\r\n\r\n1. Characters can get little more facial emotions - it looks very stagnant.\r\n2. When the characters are running through the muddy patch - it looks very flat; there is no splashes of puddle when the characters are running over it or when falling on the ground. Some amount of realism is appreciated.\r\n3.  The main character looks the same even though he gets hit - show the scars/hit on the main char too - Later you can give some kind of addon that will fix his injuries.\r\n4. Guns vs Traditional Swords - Guns would win any day/ But if you are going to showcase bullet deflection from sword you can show it holistically. That as a viewer or as a gamer can experience.",

        "text": "Game looks good, But here are some suggestions: \n\n1. While running the motion of character looks stiff. (looks like upper body especially the hand holding weapon is still and only legs and left arm are moving, the animation can be improved, \n\n2. The parry mechanism needs improvement, at 8:03 when our character blocks mace, it does not looks accurate(logically considering size of boss and his weapon vs our character in its normal form, once our character turns into an avatar, then some more enhanced mechanisn can be used there) \nfor 1 & 2 you can take inspiration from Ghost of Tushima\n\n3. The interaction with shrine feels very fast, its like just a press of button and nothing much happens on screen which does not provide the sense of achievement for completing a part or mission. The interaction can be improved at shrine. (I know you took some reference from Black Myth Wukong and balancing it from Indian religion Pov without hurting any section of society will be challenging)\n\n\nother  suggestions: \n\n1. Performance optimization for low end devices (many of my frnds still use their 4-5 yrs old laptop with specs like  - i5 8 or 9 gen, 8 gb ram, Nvidia 920MX, 930MX or 1050. And even with high end machines I have seen people avoiding to push their machines to max as the laptop generated too much heat and GPU/ GPU temps are above 90 and and fans make too much noise. So despite the hardware is able to run game on high/ ultra setting people play on low/ medium setting on laptop ( key reason is they can't afford to change/ upgrade machines every 2-3 years, and they want to last it as long as possible)\n\n2. Keeping the names of characters/ items in game a bit simpler but keeping the Indian touch and easy to pronounce especially for audience outside India as to make this project financially successful as well, a major contribution might come from other high income countries as disposable income and pc penetration in India is very low.\n\nAll the best for your journey, India definitely needed something like this",

A good aaa game doesn't just mean high quality graphics, it should have it's own feel,  story, and unique immersive gameplay.  \nNo hate but why does indian story always needs to be related to patriotism or ramayan or any other mythologies. We are capable enough to create our own story. Even if you create your own sci fi or any prehistoric game, the game will still be called an indian game. What you're doing is just using some photorealistic indian theme assets with gameplay of already existing foreign games. \nI know you have less manforce than an actual aaa studio, but that shouldn't be an excuse to make a low quality game. For example vice city is such a old with low graphics, but still provide better feel than many aaa games which are currently available. Hoping best for your game best of luck üëç.",

        "text": "(Writing from the US) This looks so cool. No pressure but if you can prove the market, indian gaming companies may start cropping up or you may have big american companies start getting interested in these markets. A suggestion for your team: Make the GAMEPLAY FUN. Look at titles like Ghost Of Tsushima. Make sure that the player is NOT dealing with bad combat mechanics. I say this because you're a videographer type and you're going to focus a lot of the visual, which is apparent by the fact that you spoke about visuals extensively. THAT SAME LEVEL OF RIGOR NEEDS TO BE IN THE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS. I'll try to share some thoughts - but generally, have your engineers also focus on the gameplay to feel enjoyable - it should take the kind of work it took to fix the visuals. Gotta go beyond the Unreal default or find libraries that make things feel much more real. ------- At 6:02, we can tell how well the cinematography is. We can tell that you love that stuff and it is showing. At 6:30 the character easily approaches a standing enemy with full running speed - ask yourself if that would be possible in real life. the NPC should punish you for being too bold and assuming the game is stupid enough to let you run up to the NPC and choke it. You also need a sense of danger - the NPC should not really stand there looking in one direction, it should have a path that it follows and its gaze should scan for enemies. It should react if it sees you. The bodies shouldn't dissolve into thin air; leave the bodies on the ground, bonus points if they stay where they are. 6:41, the reaction of the NPC is robotic. Have it show us body moment that says \"surprised!\" to us. 6:45, the slashing is okay...the wounds aren't there, the amount of blood is a but much, let our character get dirty from the blood and dirt. Look at Death Stranding (DS) - take guidance from there. You see how the chars in DS have weight, have senses, communicate with each other, make noise...do that. 6:50, the enemy should be shouting, yelling, giving you commands...hitting a sword with a gun...that is odd behavior. 6:52 when getting hit, the NPC should visibly and audibly show discomfort, fear, etc. 7:05 sequence...blood looks horrible. the NPC's eyes look dead. NPC has no power...dies easily. The other NPC stands there waiting to be activated. 7:12 HUGEEE OPPORTUNITY to have NPC try to intimidate with dialog and say something...be angry...not emotionless.  --------- so, these are just a few things. Not saying you need to get all of these right. I'm saying, if you're looking to set a standard, then SET A STANDARD for not just visuals but also gameplay from Indian devs. You have plenty of talent. Start A/B testing mechanics from other BEST in class game. STEAL from them. do not reinvent. Literally look at mechanics and copy them from the best US IPs. Not saying literally steal but saying take heavy inspiration. They've already done the work for you to figure out how good character movement is...how NPCs should react....how blood should look...how to make it look like that you and the world...and the NPCs have weight...heft. etc...BIG enemies should feel big...lumbering...they should drag heavy things. If your storyline is incredible, then that may carry the gameplay portion. But if you've made it look incredible but the gameplay itself is NOT FUN or realistic...while you've made an effort for it to be hyper realistic...and if your story is also lack luster where it's just an after thought because bunch of visual engineers are making a tech demo essentially...then, you won't get recognition. Ok, lastly, if you want to see how to get respect from the US and other countries, all you need to do is look at Hanumankind. How did he get that much respect? He did it better than what's being done here in the US. That's how you get respect. KEEP THE SCOPE OF THE LENGTH OF THE GAME SHORT, but build something worth playing. Build something which, when we play it...seems like something that we want more of. Build something that will cause american giants to reach out and say \"Hey, we wanna buy this IP or license it...or, can you work with us and have your team release a full game?\" Good luck. I really really hope that you make the best game India has ever made.",

The big part is only that he has money to spend and cheap labour in India. It's lot of grunt work. the game already looks laggy, any developer can tell that photogrammetry was used and in some places it looks bad. The reason for using photogrammetry is only because it's much much cheaper than creating all the assets. Honestly good effort and can be done with a good capital and equipments but nothing revolutionary.\n\nP.S. Before some of you start cribbing and say where is my game blah blah. I already made and left. Worked with EA, rockstar games and Ubisoft. so I know what I am talking about. Only reason they are able to do this now is capital and equipments that's it.",

I get it that this is a SOULS LIKE game but try something original. Maybe small mandirs of Hanuman Ji and a lot of our gods from which he medidates and regenerates. I can't tell about the setting but maybe the story is set that way. I really like that you are using the traditional approach by building assets from scracth. That's just as original as one can hope. Striking animation need some work as damage to the enemy is seen but not felt. Parrying is OK but heavy attacks need to be perfected and the damage from them. Dodge is great. I get that this is an alpha footage and a lot of work is incomplete. I hope I am not disappointed.",

        "text": "REVIEW AS A GAMER:-  As a hardcore gamer who has played almost all top-tier games. I am not sure about what you mean by the term \"Super High Quality\", as the game is not high quality at all. I was shocked with Intro, the surroundings looked quite realistic but when it comes to actual characters it just looks like two games combined in one. The surrounding seems like from a top tier game while the main character and playable part looks tbh, very Average. The music and sounds are fine. The type of game you chose, the story line felt very outdated, games storylines matters a lot now a days and this doesnt give a reason for me to play. \n\nReview as Viewer: Now those were my feedback as a gamer, when i see it practically, this is quite commendable to be making a game in just 8 months while having a team of 40 people is no joke. The top games in the industry takes years and years, so congratulations on that. The FPS was not good in the game but i do understand its just a demo of early stage game, so it will be obviously be improved a lot in next couple of months. Hear me out, if possible please use the components of this game and recreate the storyline, something modern, something creative, take your time and if possible ditch this game and make something entirely different, this game is bound to fail with this storyline and characters like these. Get over Mumbai and Slums. \n\nWill i play? : Answer is Maybe, depends on the price and only bc its been made here and i want to support them. I wont even have a thought of playing it if it wasn‚Äôt bc of that. I dont like the storyline, dont know why but i have seen too many games with the same storyline from India, there is no chance it will get global recognition organically without your personal image being combined. The games are mostly played by Genz and lower but this game isnt modern, not something that attracts me, maybe 30+ age group might give it a go. We need to support this industry but true feedback is required, and i can see the so much of jingoism in the comments, true feedback is not there. India Needs to get over these kind of Storyline bring something different, something that Raji did!",

Its a very outdated system for games nowadays. Bodies in Bethesda games way back in 2006 and 2008 remain in the places they were killed almost the entire game. I also think that you should work on blood work. It looks really akward and childish. Also work on the bloodspatter mechanics. Also, if visible injuries are inflicted upon the enemies, ir would add to the immersion. I also see the combat is very soft and watered down version of the soulslike games, if you could bring your own disntict flair in the battles fought it would be enhance the game overall. Good luck",

A game isn't just about vfx, animations, etc, the combat is probably the one thing that makes me play games more than anything else. When you look at a game like elden ring, the one thing that you always remember is the number of various builds that you could have (bleed, magic, dex, dex + magic, strength + dex, etc etc) which make it fun to replay. also please please don't make the bosses very easy to beat, at least give us difficulty levels to go about. I really want you guys to be a global success, not just a colloquial move. I appreciate what you guys have done with the vfx and i'm sure it'll turn out well, the only thing i'm worried about is that the game itself should be really fun to play, comparable to names like elden ring without being a mirror copy. I hope we get a game to remember! great going!",

Graphics aren't everything you need good mechanics animations, story to make it worth while\nYou guys are doing a great job but please make it a worthwhile experience take you time to refine the details add the charm it's the little things that matter.also while moving the camera unless in combat mode don't let the character move it's a big thing that move indie games miss on and it makes them look lack luster .also about the camera it's not on the right spot you need to make the camera close up while walking ,while running it should move away a little ,just a little to give that effect of motion .while combat it should be as it is in the game now, while some epic scenery it should move a little close and down towards the hip like in some Assassin's creed games. (Just a suggestion i might be wrong) you could also patner with jio games to release your game on jio cloud for the first week so more people have acess to it and later release a downloadable format so piracy won't be a very big issue.\n\nI am not trying to roast the game \nBeen playing pc game from when I was 3 (serious sam second encounter was my first game)\n\nI can feel the potential but it very rough right now it need more polishing just take it as a critics view rather than a roast or something.\n\n3.5 /5 star for the game rn\n5/5 star for the effort",

        "text": "Hi Varun, as an avid gamer and someone eagerly waiting for authentic Indian games all my life, I sincerely want you and this project to succeed, and that's why I'm going to give you honest, reality-driven feedback - \n1.) Typically, a GTA style script where the character fights locals and law enforcement inspires the wrong kind of mentality in youth. Seeing as you have yourself made of lot of educational content in your career, I would encourage you to re-imagine the script that keeps the fun intact but leans more towards morally correct story, and character development focused on education, innovation, and nation-building. You have a great potential opportunity here to distinguish your game by designing quests and campaigns that are educational and fun at the same time for the characters. (Bonus idea - maybe in same game or a different one in the future - there is potential for players to choose different professions and accordingly the gameplay changes)\n2.) I understand the need for designing characters as accurately as possible, but given that the religion and caste divide has already reached the peek of toxicity in our country, I would encourage you to refrain from portraying any specific caste/religion from being the villain. For example, the character wielding a gadaa is designed as a Brahmin but categorized as \"sankat\" by the system. Such things can subtly create strong wrong notions, prejudices and uncalled hatred in the minds of youth. You yourself said that people should be able to carry the memory of a character for lifetime. Well, it's your responsibility that players don't carry a wrongful memory (even if it's unintentional) throughout their lives and hate someone based on their caste. Not to mention the potential for political controversies.\nIt's clear that a lot of hard work, money, and time has gone into this already. And kudos to you and the team for making it so far. Just be responsible with the actual game script, characters and character development, and you'll have a superhit release right out the gate. Genuinely wishing you and the team success! ü™î‚úå",

Add some nuance to the combat, it's just slash and dodge right now. maybe parry, non dodgeable attacks and some more basic attack variations. Since it's in early development, i can also give the advice of improving charcter models. The stealth kill animation needs some polishing and the after body effects. Like some wounds and character deterioation (pardon my spelling) for when hit. All in all this looks super promising! Excited to see where this goes!",

So there is intrest towards eastern game. \n4- we only want one game with great mechanics and movement and art style to break the ice. \n5- I am still not convinced with  character style (npc). Looks not up to standard in my opinion.\n\nHope your game will bring changes in Indian gaming market.",

The settings seems modern day Mumbai. Why is the main character using swords?\n3. Please work on facial animations a bit. The character models do not show any expressions during combat or parkour.\n4. Scale seems to be off, the character models are looking way too large compared to the environment.\n5. Something needs to be done about the choppy framerate.\n6. This seems like a souls like game hence, more attention needs to be paid towards telegraphng boss attacks. Right now it seems all too simple and predictable.\n7. Shrines as checkpoints seem out of place considering the modern day setting.\n8. Unreal engine 4? Please do make sure that the final game doesn't ave any shader compilation stutters.\n9. The focus on photo realism is too heavy. While this may be a good thing, this will eventually lead to the team ignoring the overall gameplay. Focus more in improving the gameplay loop and make the game more responsive and gameplay more captivating. Graphics can follow later.\n10. Please please hire well experienced managers who are good human beings as well. Endevours like this often fail due to incompetent managers with bloated ego.\n\nHaving said that, this is a real good effort considering it has been built in India. Please work on the points above and this just might have a fighting chance.",

I might sound like an angry grifter but I just wanna see great things coming out of us,\n Indians tend to settle for mediocre things despite having better minds on said job\n\none more thing which absolutely troubled me by seeing all the amazing work done on visual aspect is Performance 19:45 you finally mentioned it but called it a joke just because it raises too many things to worry about, I'd like to remind you of cyberpunk, fallout 76 and No man's sky on its release dates, they failed miserably because of poor optimization and it alienated majority of the gamers from those games despite the hype so please don't take performance and optimization lightly.\nYou mentioned at the end  how important it is to reach bigger audiences which brings me great Joy that someone is aiming higher than just local audience \nAs a very passionate gamer who likes slow paced story driven games like Hellblade, Red dead, the last of us and some occasional combat experiences like sekiro, Dead cells, witcher. I really love the focus points of this game being the combat ,story and the progression \nI really wish the best for your game!",

But the environment doesn't fit well , the dusty Screenshot of building you presented looked better than the character fighting i.e during the motion of character its not feeling that they are connecting (I don't know how to say this but this is how it felt).\n--The enemies didn't feel THREATENING, its like they waiting too long, THEY SHOULD WAIT BUT IT FELT TOO LONG AND WEAK (you know what i mean right ,Eg: sekiro common enemies would fuck you up but here it felt like they can't do anything unless you are distracted and have not paused the game)\n--Make the Visuals look like top view of city you showed in the pictures\n--The SANKAT word when an Undodgeable attack comes looks too big and distracting please make it smaller. (Its a small nitpick but If you see this please consider)\n\nI hope the game is fun for both casual and hardcore gamers, and i hope you all the best (I like difficult but fair games, and it looks like a game i will love ).",

For many people it might look a bit weird too. \n\nWhat can be done is, let's make 4-5 levels of transformation with power levels in ascending order. \nEg. \n1) Slight color change and two bracelets appearing on both of his hands.\n(This will be for fighting tougher individual opponents) \n\n2) A tiara type thing (which was shown in the video) appears oh his head and a locket appears. (His colour would remain the same as level 1) \n\n3) His shirt Vanishes and a few more ornaments appear. The colour changes completely. (This will be the most powerful form which he can control) \n\n4) The final form, \n(basically the one you showed entirely in the video) \nwhich he'll never be able to control properly, for that he'll have to undergo a lot of psychological, philosophical and mental training. \nAll the other forms will just be an incomplete invocation/manifestation of the final form. \n\nJust a suggestion tho‚ù§\nKeep up the good work.\nCan't express my happiness towards the creative work.‚ù§",

Here also the difficulty seem to be good he was really stopping us to get close and attack. \n\nwhen i saw the deathblow red dot. i started to think isn't there any way to show this in Indian way like chakra point or anything.  You can take some move set and twist it according to game like Mikri counter it feels great when using it.\n\nanyway the main reason for this comment was the smoothness of movement. There are games where the movement flows like a wave and there are games which just doesn't feel like playing because of controls. I can't really explain but if i have to put it into words, I could say Imagine switching direction from going top left to top right, in bad controls it feels like a quick sharp turn and also after switching direction the player walks in a straight line like its little rigid on its movement. In good games the corners take smooth curvy switch. \n\nBy The Way Sekiro is my Favourite Game üòâ‚ù§",

Major market is mobile gaming..\n\nSo, I really want you guys to focus on foreign markets.. \"MAKE AN INDIAN MADE GAME FOR FOREIGN MARKET\"\nRaji is the only game that somewhat succeeded in this\n\nIf you make this game targeting Indian audience, then you will be ultimately forced to port this to mobile which makes all the real high quality photogrammetry just a waste of time and resources.. Also Indians are only used to MMO gaming thanks to PUBG but not much to RPGs\n\nSo, I request Varun and team to focus on West and promote this for West, like Wukong and other games..\nThis has the potential. Forget about India. There is a huge market for Indian made stuff in the West. RRR is a great example of that. West got tired of their products. They want to try new cultures. So, keep it culture appropriate and market for the West..\n\nfeedback - The game and mechanics are looking great but lacks distinction to attract large audience is what I feel.. I believe that part is where this footage ended. So, I guess there will be distinction.. For the final product, do some distinct color grade in the post process volume and kindly avoid that typical Unreal look..\n\nCongrats and All the bestüëèüëèüëè\nSalute to whatever you guys accomplished till now.

And with all the woke garbage modern gaming companies are promoting, it feels like a breathe of fresh air and reminisced us about our childhoold.

I'm requesting you to take your time, work on the story, the gameplay could be improved. This has a lot potential and maybe a start for something bigger.

It has real potential to be big because of its authenticity. I just have one constructive criticism or input (if it matters): there is no backstory or character explanation in the position they are in, the get-up, and the reason for their powers. The Explanation would be awesome even in trailer form or cutscenes. So far, it just seems like a typical indian superhero like Hero (with the ring), Shiktiman, etc. Who are cool but seems a little outdated way to explain a hero's origin and reason for powers. It seems you are tapping into the mythical godly characters like Shiva or Krishna, but please make it its own genuine thing if that makes sense.\nA genuine and unique story with original and authentic characters and world-building (which you have built in some sense, story-wise). The STORY is the Heart of this kind of project, be it a Movie, TV show, or game.\nI am looking forward to seeing whatflavor you givee it and what world-building and character stories you create around it.",

Graphics aren‚Äôt everything‚Äîwhat truly matters is a good story, solid mechanics, and overall gameplay. I understand there are many challenges for a beginner-level studio like yours (such as adding facial expressions), but I really appreciate the effort you‚Äôre putting in.\n\nIf you‚Äôve read this far, I just want to add:\nDon‚Äôt take on unnecessary pressure.\nDon‚Äôt sell lies.\nDon‚Äôt do false promotions.\nJust be yourself, and success will follow.\n\nGodspeed, Varun!",

This is not discouragement, but hope that you won't ignore the things that I mention below. Two things: The story and The mechanics of the game. The story being the most important. The machanics beings how much can the user control of what they are free to do while playing the game. Hope for the best for you and your company. Hope that you will make a good combat loop that would make it a very good game for the world.",

On top of that are you guys sure that you guys aren't just trying to play with religious emotions by implementing Indian style shrines and the OM on the title screen?

The discussion around the game‚Äôs visuals and asset creation was impressive, and it‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs a lot of high-quality work going into the design. \nThat said, some elements could use a bit more polish‚Äîparticularly the graphics, where things like the grass feel slightly off, though it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly why.\n\nIt seems like a lot of focus has been on the game‚Äôs aesthetics, which look stunning, but I‚Äôm really hoping the gameplay matches that standard. \nFrom the demo, the combat appeared a bit straightforward; for example, strafing was enough to dodge the boss‚Äôs attacks. I‚Äôm curious about the game‚Äôs target audience. \nIs it aimed at Soulslike players (e.g., Elden Ring, Lies of P) who crave deep, challenging mechanics, or is it leaning more toward a broader action game style (e.g., God of War)?\n\nFor serious gamers, especially FromSoftware fans, gameplay mechanics and difficulty balance are often more important than visuals. \nIf Project 11A is targeting the Soulslike crowd, I hope the final product delivers a fair but punishing difficulty curve with rewarding mechanics. \nIt‚Äôs not entirely clear yet how much of the Soulslike philosophy will shape the game or if it‚Äôs going for a more accessible action vibe, but I‚Äôm excited to see where it lands!",

Finally someone has taken the initiative, building a huge library of scans and that too of such large volumes, these processes surely does take time but once done, the outcomes will always blow your mind, and its clearly visible in the video, the high quality 3D assets, are just WOW!! Incredible job guys. High and Best Quality should be the north metric of any such product if you are aiming for long run. \n\nKudos to AEOS team and to you Varun!

The combat weirdly feels too slow and heavy for some reason, maybe it's just the framerate. Keep in mind that for gameplay like Sekiro you would need at the least 60fps.. \n\n2.) Character design feels a bit uninspired \n\n3.) The Map and the environment is a bit too real, in the sense it doesn't have that ethereal more dramatic look that I would expect from a game, in short it looks realistic not artistic, no offense to the artist involved lol... \n \n4.) Something that you would need to keep in mind is that most people who will be trying this game i.e. the Indian people, they are usually not using super-high end system, and seeing the in-game framerate makes me kind of worried.. \n\nI am sure you would there is still a lot of work to do, but please keep in mind that chances of creating games a financially successful game is still 50-50. Take a look at Bethesda or Ubisoft.. To create something good it doesn't need to be unique but it needs to be super-refined either in terms of mechanics, story-telling or gameplay loop just pick one or two and you'd be golden!\n\nBut however it goes, I'll be rooting for you guys success!",

Please take as much time as you need, seek objective feedback without any biases and make something great, because the demo does not excite so far.

        "text": "Hi! I really love what you and your team are doing, and I really respect the steps taken by you guys in the Indian Game development industry. I do have some feedback, as I want this project to actually be a success even worldwide.\n\nI would strongly suggest you focus more on game feel, as judging from the little gameplay trailer shown in the video, the gameplay (especially the game feel/feedback) seems lacking in some aspects. The souls-like gameplay does feel slightly out of place in a very modern-looking environment. It doesn't feel connected enough. One of the reasons may be because of the very realistic-looking graphics do not fit in place with the gameplay, or the lack of player feedback. Game feel is a really important factor in a game, even more so than how realistic the graphics are. There are a ton of examples of great, successful games having very basic graphics but still very fun, and if I'm gonna be completely honest, the game (of course, only judging from the small gameplay in the video) doesn't look that fun to play.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not hating on this. In fact, I'm really excited about this as I'm also an aspiring game developer from India, currently working on a game of mine as well. I'm saying this BECAUSE I want this to be a success.\n\nAnother feedback I would like to give is to have play tests with people who aren't emotionally connected to this project (which is also suggested by some other comments), as people who are connected to the project will have biases.\n\nI do expect many fixes and improvements in the future, as I'm assuming this project, though 60-70% done as said by you in the video, is still in the early stages where there are lots of minor fixes and polishing to be done, and I will be keeping myself up-to-date on this project.\n\nI would love to give more constructive and detailed feedback on this, but it's 3 a.m. while I'm writing this, and so I should probably sleep...",

Fast-paced fights are better, hope there are multiple weapons, character leveling, indian warrior costumes ( we are blessed in this as we have so many different cultures here), and cool and strong bosses, and that it requires certain skills in players to defeat them like in elden ring. I am so excited for this, after years of playing games made in other countries it's finally our chance. hope you talk with other gamers, not just Indian ones but from the market you are trying to target (US and Europe), about what they feel is missing in the latest games and what they like(hell lot of games are getting cancelled and not selling recently).

Atleast, you could have made it mythological so that it doesn't inspire crime - Most movies involving violence are given an A certificate only 18+ but because these games usually land up even at the hands of impressionable teenagers, this is going to influence them in negative ways - This is the real drawback of the entire exercise - Otherwise, a worthy endeavour - Hope you can course correct!

As an Indian i cant wait for a banger game from an Indian Studio; but building a low quality(not talking about graphics) game and expecting support from Indian audience will be kinda sad.",

I just have some suggestions:\ni) Try to make combat more viceral and put more weight/punch to it by focusing on hitboxes and sound fx (can take inspiration for ghost of tsushima and gears)\nii) avoid too much slo mo scenes and those weird poses during combat.\niii) I am hoping good quality writing for you guys, no matter how good gameplay and visuals are, without good narrative, lore and worldbuilding it will feel shallow. (can take inspiration from Witcher 3, BG3 and KCD)\niv) Don't put Ubisoft style fetch quests and ? marks to fill the map. Put quality side contents on per with main quests. Quality over quantity.

But here's what's going to happen -\nyou made some custom 3D presets, and made a physics and logic with a mixture 2-3 studios like Rockstar and Ubisoft. Indian gamers will go crazy over this gameplay. But the uniqueness, individual storyline and the feeling of a game will be missing forever. Every game has a soul, otherwise this will be nothing more than just like MOD to any game. People will start commenting \"I have never seen something like that\" OR \"The indian gaming scene is changing\" for some time, but we all know what is the reality my man. These will be the first people to give curses to the game after the beta release, trust me. They don't care about the budgets, the marketing, the level designing, storylining, version updates or anything. We all have seen what happened to mumbai gullies. For one time, we can praise Raji here. But did indians really paid for that game? No. They do not pay for games like that. They want an Indian GTA... that's their ultimate dream, they don't see anything far from that. If you think this project could go further, definitely work on it. But don't forget that you are making just A GAME. You are making no GTA, no Far Cry, no Call Of Duty. It's a game, and it should have it's own soul. They criticized Fauji, because they wanted PUBG. They criticized Mumbai Gullies, because they expected GTA. Do not repeat the same mistake again after looking at the initial positive response. You will need heavy feedback from people who you can't find in comments. Think about it. I know this might sound triggering to some of the people here, but I am expecting a mature audience reaction, other than that my best wishes are with you. Come on guys, show the world that we are not just a tinkering lab, we can create something on our own! Let's not make cheap copies of big titles, this is time to get dirty with some real business.",

The environment is very loyal to that of ACTUAL Indian \"gullies\", but I would suggest to make the lighting to be a bit dimmer, i.e., it should give an unsettling feeling as y'know how in a lot of movies they make it a bit darker when the entire story is going on, to make it look like the bad is currently in the power and good hasn't yet prevailed thus giving idea of the entire situation through just the environment, it would also help you guys with the background detailing, as a bit darker environment can cover up a lot of imperfections in the background, it's just a small suggestion as a game lover, all the best guys üëç",

It pleases my heart to see good development happening in India, after feeling that we lack so much behind than China in every other technical aspect nowadays. \nA small suggestion, I know you wanted to make everything feel so real, but I believe that because this will be such a great game and you have a massive following, this game will reach international market, and I think it won't be best to show all the dump, trash and unhygienic streets. It would build on the stereotype of Indians in the mind of foreigners.",

I am comparing you to that of Dark soul games because you said you want it to be the highest. It's a big step yes, but it feels off. India has a lot of amazing history and we will surely make games like wu kong based on our history.This is really amazing. I hope my feedback gets considered.

Huge congratulations on everything you‚Äôve achieved so far and I truly hope this is just the beginning of an amazing journey ahead!\n\nThat said, I found myself a bit confused about the overall setting of the game. The mix of swordplay with enemies wielding guns, followed by a larger boss carrying a gada, left me unsure of the world you‚Äôre trying to build. The equipment selection/save area, designed like a small shrine or temple, also felt slightly out of place compared to the rest of the environment.\n\nMaybe a bit more context or environmental storytelling could help tie everything together and give players a clearer sense of the game‚Äôs universe. Still, super impressive work, and I‚Äôm excited to see where this goes next!",

        "text": "WOW! never thought we would see a game from Varun and team.\n\nThe game is awesome but I don't know why something feels off.\nMaybe the game is set as realistic graphics (less cinematic) so the expectations in animations and other things are going to be high.\n\nScreenshots are already great, even better than other games, may be the character or facial animation part making the game feel odd. I don't know may be the game needs post processing effects or high FOV is the reason. I prefer low FOV games, it feels more immersive.\n\nAs the game is set to release in 2025, expectations are only going high. Please make it the best.",

        "text": "Feedback: Looks very cool. I do expect some improvements though. The look of Typical India city is perfectly seen. Some inputs from me:\n1. Make the blood spill from Asuras be a different colour than human - black will be nice.\n2. More special effects needed on the Gada hit from the boss - especially when he hits the ground, it should create an earthquake, or make the earth crack up. The Tractor and Thela could fly off due to the impact.\n3. Make the Sankat a little bit smaller. Make health bars a bit larger. (It looks like you took inspiration from Spidey sense).\n4. I hope it supports upto 120 fps in the future. DLSS support will be nice.\n5. If you have to hire a really good storywriter and editor because story is most important part of such a game. Brahmastra spent so much on graphics but story was dogs**t. Impressing international audience requires a very nuanced story. Especially one with twists. Ramayana is a great epic and story but it lacks the spiciness. Mahabharat though is full of spicy.\n6. I hope there are more slo mo special moves like the protagonist did there to dodge.\n7. A few textures especially on characters could be little bit more detailed. Environment is perfect imo. The necklace on boss looks fake and floating in air. \n8. Hire a martial artist if you haven't already for the moves, makes a huge difference.\n9. Make the protagonist's weapon a bit larger.\n10. More people (Spectators watching you fight) and more interactions with environment will be nice. It will be difficult to give them actions or emotions. Like they could be anxious if you get injured, or happy when you hit them.\n11. Gameplay looks very slow. I see so many elements inspired by Wukong, but gameplay is much slower here. You'll need to do drastic changes if you want to make gameplay feel faster.\n12. Needs a lot of Dialogue. I suggest you hire someone for that too. The character must feel very real. Some humour, som serious, some sad cut scenes or events.\n\nI'm extremely excited for the game. Will definitely buy it. I want to see Aeos become as big as Tencent, Rockstar, Epic, Riot & EA. I'm very very thankful. You and your team have got that Risk taking ability that we say is lacking in India. Even Wukong took $42 million to develop, which is already very cheap forAAA (Cyberpunk cost more than 10 times that). I'm guessing you're working with even smaller amount, so it's a huge challenge. I wish you the best of Luck",

When the player slashes the NPCs, there is no visible wounds or blood stains spilled on the ground. Even on their clothes or the player's clothes!! Without inflicted wounds and tarnishes on the clothes, it seems to be just an objective and not an actual battle.\n2. Similarly, when the blood splashes on to the player, there are no visible stains either on his clothes or swords(maybe the sword can be ignored, as such fine detailing may not be visible even in 4K). We can have these blood stains on the player and reset them when the player heals near the shrine so that the clothes don't seem bloody all the time.\n3. The assets on Kshudita asura are not on his body, they seem to float (example the neck gold ornaments). Sometimes they seem to disappear and appear frequently as well when the asura is fighting the player.",

        "text": "My Honest Take (Hope You Consider These Points):\n\nFirst of all, huge kudos to you guys for this god-tier work. Seriously, hats off. But I hope you‚Äôre considering the following points‚Äîjust my honest thoughts after watching the trailer:\n\n1. The Game Being Your First Release:\nThis is your debut title, so it has to be a killer. What usually happens in India is that due to lack of funding, the first game from a new studio often falls short. It doesn't match the quality of already established international companies, and the usual justification becomes: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre new, we‚Äôre small, we don‚Äôt have enough funds, what do you expect?‚Äù\nBut for gamers‚Äîthese excuses don‚Äôt really fly.\nThey want the best of the best‚Äîstory mode, graphics, gameplay, sound design‚Äîeverything needs to hit the current benchmark. You can't use ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just starting out‚Äù as a reason for a downgrade in all aspects and hope that things will improve later. There‚Äôs no space for that anymore.\nSo I hope you guys are keeping this in mind.\n\n\n2. Indian Representation & Personal Mental Shift:\nNow this might be personal, but I felt it strongly. You‚Äôve done an amazing job trying to represent India‚Äîthe cities, the people, weapons, clothes, everything.\nBut here‚Äôs the thing: We‚Äôve been playing games from smaller US-based and other global studios for years. And there‚Äôs a certain ‚Äúmental shift‚Äù that happens when I see an Indian game attempting this scale.\nLike, when I saw that overweight villain with the weapon, something felt... off. Can‚Äôt really explain it, but it gave me a weird vibe. Maybe it‚Äôs just because we‚Äôre not used to seeing such characters in high-budget, polished form. It might take time to fully accept it‚Äîbut yeah, it struck me. Hope you get the point I‚Äôm trying to make.\n\n\n3. Open World Demands Perfection:\nYou guys are making an open-world game‚Äîand in that case, nothing can be compromised.\nThe initial cinematic shots you showed were insanely good. For the first time, it genuinely felt like an Indian studio is doing something exceptional.\nBut the moment the actual gameplay started, my brain automatically reset expectations. Probably because we already have benchmarks for what gameplay, graphics, sound, etc., should look and feel like.\nSo while the cinematic shots were jaw-dropping, the gameplay brought me back to ‚ÄúOkay, this looks decent, but not mind-blowing.‚Äù That contrast hit hard.",

For example, when the giant man with the gada hit the sword, the boy‚Äôs body reaction could‚Äôve been more impactful. Also, how come there wasn‚Äôt any conversation between them?\n\nThat said, the map and the village shown in the game look absolutely amazing. A huge round of applause for this amazing work.

I'm very glad someone like you is spearheading the much needed change. However, seeing the preview made me think \"oh so its just an Indian Sekiro\", and I'm certain a few others might've thought the same. I know this is just a small preview and might now be representative of the end product and that this is the first attempt at a big game made in India, But I hope people will remember it for more than just being an \"Indian Sekiro\". Idk if Im in any position to give advice but i hope you take as much time polishing the gameplay as needed. Wishing you all the best for this project!",

They can be more dynamic and this will allow for more dynamic combos. Invest more efforts into the combat ai system, from Prince of Persia to Assasins Creed.\nAlready l can see a solid foundation.\nPlease remember.\nGameplay Gameplay Gameplay is what will sell the experience.",
