@abhishekprajapat415,Thanks for the start. It doesn't matter even if this game fails. What you have done is lay the foundation. You have experience that you can use in other games too along with the assets. I am soo happy that someone is taking the risk. Just a small support from my side.

@Graveness4920,Although I don’t particularly like your presentation style  I’m giving you another chance. The game looks excellent  especially considering it is still in its early phase of development. I’m glad that India has genuine risk-takers like you rather than just “keyboard warriors” like myself.  I also want to share a piece of advice: in software development  it’s a good practice to ask an engineer for an estimate and then double it for planning purposes but please don’t mention this trick to the engineer.  One concern I have about the video is the claim that the game is 60% complete in 10 months. Honestly  that isn’t a realistic timeline for game development; it usually takes at least 2 to 3 years.  That said  you have an amazing and promising team. Thanks for the introduction!,True,₹,2000.00
@p.j.h2401,I absolutely love the concept. Not a fan of presentation though. Please hire a marketing and product guy who will put a clear image in front of developers.

@kilutica3D,You and your team are doing incredible work—much respect for what you’re building. Based on the insights you’ve shared  it’s clear how challenging it must be to create a AAA title from scratch  especially in India  where startups face significant risks and the gaming industry is still in its infancy.    I sincerely hope you succeed in this endeavor  becoming a major contributor to the field in India and helping pave the way for the growth of game development  3D modeling  coding  and more. Your work has the potential to inspire and introduce gaming as a thriving industry in the region.    Thank you for sharing this amazing journey—I’ve subscribed  shared  and will be eagerly following updates. Your project looks phenomenal  a global-scale competitor with style! Wishing you all the best!,True,₹,500.00
@RiyanJunaid,Can't do much since I don't earn anything rn this is the most I can do but really love the efforts because I am seriously annoyed by how the Indian government doesn't provide separate regulations for the gaming industry and considers it the same as gambling applications  and how china with no prior experience in the pc and console gaming industry and only having mobile games till now successfully entered the market with a great game like black myth wukong while india still isn't even able to properly enter the mobile market or any market at this point.

@locknloadspreon,Just a thought… the combat looks dangerously similar to Sekiro (especially the parries and the red “Sankat” prompt). I understand that this is supposed to be a souls-like game but if there could be something done that would make the combat seem unique  it would really set this game apart. Because after all the tremendous efforts your team has put in  I would hate for the world to label this as a “cheap copy of Sekiro” without even trying it. (Because the world is filled with yappers and unfortunately  these yappers make or break greatness)  That being said  there is no doubt your efforts will make every Indian proud.  Thank you for doing what nobody else would. I hope this causes a revolution in the Indian gaming industry (and the world).,True,$,4.99

@prajyotkumar9644,There are some suggestions if you like.  1. Normal enemies are too calm  they should be a bit more aggressive to feel a certain tension. 2. Attack feels hollow  it needs to have a bit more animation. You can shake the camera a bit more dramatically for that especially the attacks after parrying. 3. Enviroment is too small. I think some bigger games had this issue in past and it almost killed that game so Make your environment big so people don't feel like they are constrained. 4. Same with boss  the aftereffects of his attack were good but he heavily lacked variety and also his attacks when it hit the character were lackluster. Also every enemy of yours felt slow in movement.   Since its alpha build  I hope you take these into consideration. Good luck,False,None,0

@shubharthidasgupta25,Just like everyone else  the first order of things is a big congratulations. You are doing a great job. But  I wanted to highlight a small thing  and perhaps a different perspective/take.  - The game looks great. But it won't matter much if the performance is not that good. Whatever happens  the game should run consistently well and bug-free at 60fps+. That would be my personal number one priority  even over the graphics. I am prepared to play a game with mediocre graphics if it has a good and engaging story and runs wells. It may be early days  but the first look and gameplay did not look so smooth. The animations look jittery  missing frames  etc. I am sure with the crew you have those will not be overlooked. Hopefully later on with more polish the game FEELS good  not just look good. MOBAs are a good example of this.  - The story HAS to be engaging. It can be a short 10-15 hour story  but it has to hook the players till the end. Even if it means less side quests and collectibles. Sifu is a great example of a brilliantly done short game.  Best of luck to you guys and you are doing an awesome job. Keep up the good work!,True,₹,500.00

@GautamSingh-bk3cq,The entire gameplay mechanic feels like a copy of Sekiro . From the lock-on system to the parry mechanics  everything screams “uninspired imitation ” and to make matters worse  these core systems haven’t even been implemented properly. The combat lacks fluidity  and the timing feels off  making it more frustrating than engaging. On top of that  the narrative continuity is completely absurd—how are we supposed to believe that an average Mumbaikar can suddenly pull off advanced Shinobi techniques? It completely breaks immersion and comes across as poorly thought out fanfiction rather than a grounded or coherent story.  Instead of attempting to create yet another half-baked “Soulsborne” clone or trying to build the next so-called “GTA killer” without the budget  talent pool  or years of R&D that studios like Rockstar pour into their projects  developers should focus on originality and cultural depth. Take Raji as a shining example—a beautifully crafted game by Indian developers that authentically integrates Indian mythology and storytelling into its gameplay and visual design. It’s unique  rooted in our culture  and most importantly  it respects the intelligence and expectations of its audience. Rather than chasing trends or mimicking global giants  maybe it’s time we start creating games that reflect our own narratives  legends  and creativity with sincerity and innovation.,False,None,0

@ShinAkuma,"Super High Quality" in the title has the same energy as "Superpower by 2020",False,None,0
@vinamrajha,REVIEW AS A GAMER:-  As a hardcore gamer who has played almost all top-tier games. I am not sure about what you mean by the term "Super High Quality"  as the game is not high quality at all. I was shocked with Intro  the surroundings looked quite realistic but when it comes to actual characters it just looks like two games combined in one. The surrounding seems like from a top tier game while the main character and playable part looks tbh  very Average. The music and sounds are fine. The type of game you chose  the story line felt very outdated  games storylines matters a lot now a days and this doesnt give a reason for me to play.   Review as Viewer: Now those were my feedback as a gamer  when i see it practically  this is quite commendable to be making a game in just 8 months while having a team of 40 people is no joke. The top games in the industry takes years and years  so congratulations on that. The FPS was not good in the game but i do understand its just a demo of early stage game  so it will be obviously be improved a lot in next couple of months. Hear me out  if possible please use the components of this game and recreate the storyline  something modern  something creative  take your time and if possible ditch this game and make something entirely different  this game is bound to fail with this storyline and characters like these. Get over Mumbai and Slums.   Will i play? : Answer is Maybe  depends on the price and only bc its been made here and i want to support them. I wont even have a thought of playing it if it wasn’t bc of that. I dont like the storyline  dont know why but i have seen too many games with the same storyline from India  there is no chance it will get global recognition organically without your personal image being combined. The games are mostly played by Genz and lower but this game isnt modern  not something that attracts me  maybe 30+ age group might give it a go. We need to support this industry but true feedback is required  and i can see the so much of jingoism in the comments  true feedback is not there. India Needs to get over these kind of Storyline bring something different  something that Raji did!,False,None,0

@arrshK,I hope you are open to critiques coz oh boy i have a lot to talk about this!  You guys are aiming to set a benchmark which is already quite high with souls games and good AAA games (only comparing in your competing market) so it will be a really tough job to make this game ab ove par and i can see that you people gave done an mind-blowing job :D   Now lets talk about the game itself...  Since the footage we saw was the alpha build i wont be too harsh and not point the obvious.  Assets: you said it yourself nothing for me to talk about. 10/10  Gameplay: The first thing i notices is that you took inspiration from both Black Myth Wukong and Sekiro (which you stated later) and i am really excited about it because i SALIVATE on sekiro combat! Yes some polishing can be done but lets ot talk about it. And i am assuming you got the Shrine and the over the top dodging animation from BMW and i really like it but the only problem that i can see with what we've seen till now is that the combat isnt as interesting... Sure the system itself is from sekiro but the combat moveset seems sluggish and limited. Thats all i can say about the GamePlay and combat based on what we've seen.  NPCs: They look uncanny and very off  i would suggest looking into Yakuza Games and how they do it.  Story: Since youve kept the story a secret i cannt judge the footage from it but all i can say is  citing Hollow Knight's Gametester "everything needs to fit in the world  nothing should feel out of place." and i stand by this golden rule and this raises lots of questions in my mind. Why is the mc dressed like that? Why is the starting area is mumbai slums? why does the main character have an anciant sword while everyone else is using things similar to danda? Why are we fighting priests in the SLUMS? Why are we killing normal residents? why are the police involved? I would love the story to answer these questions and raise more!  Music: Pretty good! cant say further due to limited footage  Aaand thats it! Thats all what i have to say about the current state of the game that has been released to public. I am really looking forward to what comes next and making our nation stand out (in a +ve way ) in the video game feild :D  - Arrsh,False,None,0

@anushchandrashetty,Great CGI!! But since it is an early build  please allow me to play the devil's advocate (coz I really want this game to be the definition of perfection):  1. When the player slashes the NPCs  there is no visible wounds or blood stains spilled on the ground. Even on their clothes or the player's clothes!! Without inflicted wounds and tarnishes on the clothes  it seems to be just an objective and not an actual battle. 2. Similarly  when the blood splashes on to the player  there are no visible stains either on his clothes or swords(maybe the sword can be ignored  as such fine detailing may not be visible even in 4K). We can have these blood stains on the player and reset them when the player heals near the shrine so that the clothes don't seem bloody all the time. 3. The assets on Kshudita asura are not on his body  they seem to float (example the neck gold ornaments). Sometimes they seem to disappear and appear frequently as well when the asura is fighting the player.,False,None,0

@_.hrsht._,One suggestion on the unlesshing of Avatar.   I'd say  do it in certain levels. Like the form you showed while our MC was fighting that gigantic man is too over powered. For many people it might look a bit weird too.   What can be done is  let's make 4-5 levels of transformation with power levels in ascending order.  Eg.  1) Slight color change and two bracelets appearing on both of his hands. (This will be for fighting tougher individual opponents)   2) A tiara type thing (which was shown in the video) appears oh his head and a locket appears. (His colour would remain the same as level 1)   3) His shirt Vanishes and a few more ornaments appear. The colour changes completely. (This will be the most powerful form which he can control)   4) The final form   (basically the one you showed entirely in the video)  which he'll never be able to control properly  for that he'll have to undergo a lot of psychological  philosophical and mental training.  All the other forms will just be an incomplete invocation/manifestation of the final form.   Just a suggestion tho Keep up the good work. Can't express my happiness towards the creative work.,False,None,0

@The8merp,I can't imagine how much work went into designing those textures  but the backgrounds really captures the grit of Indian cities unlike anything I have seen before.

@DS00099,I truly wish for your success in this journey but I believe a bit of criticism is necessary here. People from other countries often glorify only good parts from their cities and because we see those parts  We believe that’s the whole reality But the truth is  They have problems too  Just like we do.    The difference is  While they focus on showcasing the good  We tend to focus only on the bad. We believe we’re being truthful by showing the harsh realities and yes  that is part of the truth but then people start to think that’s the whole truth about us. It gives an incomplete and often unfair picture.    Also  you’ll never see trash being thrown near small temples in those places or temples being built next to open drains.

@iamvanshikapandey,This is a dream come true. As a kid  I used to hope there was a game which accurately portrayed India a game which highlighted our rich cultures  beautiful landscapes  varied environments  and spectacular natural beauty. A game which fulfills everything from snow-covered mountains to green plains  clean rivers  and vast expanse of greens. It does not have to be 100% realistic to the world this can be a game of fun and creativity. A good story  breathtaking graphics  and a lively atmosphere would make it unforgettable.  I recall thinking as a child  'I will create a game that is famous throughout the world for its culture and beauty ' but I never quite reached it. To see this finally coming to fruition is just so fulfilling. Good luck to your team  I hope you make something truly amazing. Make this game a masterpiece!,False,None,0
@aaritranjanmaity5624,I will come with this criticism. This game 'feels" like ass. If graphics were the only thing that mattered then games like ultrakill would not have been so critically acclaimed. You are making a game not a movie  so focus on the gameplay mechanic first. Its choppy  sloppy  and doesn't feel fun. It's like those old phone game  space shooter and stuff  but with better graphics.   Heres what I suggest  for player  make his swings sharp. By that I mean delete some frames in his animation so the swing of the weapon feels like a gun shot. To make it seem more powerful  some particle effects on hit can work. In souls like  victory over enemies must feel earned. So instead  try making enemies with a non subtle variety of attacks  and give them some characteristics.  By characteristics  I mean like imagine two different kind of enemies  a heavy guy and a light guy. Heavy guy's attack will be telegraphed  but he will attack strong. His defense will be High as well  and some change in sound effects may do the trick while fighting him (A feedback mechanism will be good too). The light guy will fight fast and will drain your hp if you are not quick enough. Do the same thing with his attacks as you did with the player. Heres another thing. I mean seriously  I can't really anymore more about this  but it feels like a 3d project rather than  well  a 'game'.,False,None,0

@ryokorp5393,Good idea but here are some suggestions: 1.Gameplay straight up looks like sekiro shadows die twice. Its not a bad thing but innovate on the idea.  2. Remove the shrine thing. Add temples/mandirs instead  see ? Some simple tweeks here and there would solve the problems but those tweask should be innovative or creative imo. 2. Dont make the combat souls like if that was your vision initially or is now after i have seen everyone sayin the enemies should be aggressive or something.yess the enemies should be aggressive but the gameplay shouldnt be relying on fast movements like sekiro but a mix of gameplay complexities and fast movement. By gameplay complexity i mean rpg elements that enhances your character in unique ways. Keep it balanced for a engaging yet challanging combat. Gameplay>>> graphics just dont try to make this a souls like pls  3. Doesn't matter if the game is of 20 hours or 10 but dont make the things repetitive. Always keep adding new things as the game progresses and not the in the spoon feeding way but keep it just this much open so it allows a sense of discovery  kind of like botw tofk. Actually it would be very fun and interesting to have a botw tofk kinda game from india that doesnt go flashy with being a aaa game but just stays fun  engaging yet challenging.

@debanganchakraborty117,Great work done by the team! But why does some of it feel like Sekiro? Though it's the alpha build  animations and combat mechanics can be much better. You have the time  please focus on improving the game mechanics and story more than just the graphics. Also judging from the graphics (with probably further enhancements in the future) it looks like this game would be heavy hardware demanding (maybe RTX 40 or 50 series GPUs at bare minimum). Please optimize the game so that a large number of players with mid range rigs can also get interested in buying and playing the game.   Games like black myth wukong are kinda play once type of game because their only objective is to deliver an immersive story. UTA's development should also be more biased towards the story imo so that it becomes a successful launch.  Please consider this as a small piece of suggestion from a gamer's end.

@tat_smilyboy6518,Hi Varun/Aeos                             I am Darahas just finished watching the video. As i was watching it all I could think about while watching the stream was that thanos meme "I will do it myself". As an aspiring indie dev you are in a way laying the road for me.                                                      As for the suggestions:    1.Take your goddamn time: NO ONE is rushing you take another year atleast postpone the game when you have a great product done the only thing you need to do is refine it.    2.Animation: I think you might heard of the uncanny valley effect. The faces in the game are close to it also I have noticed there are no facial movement or expressions. The animation where the main character brushes his hair is awful. Animate th hair please.     3.Price: As you know India is a price sensitive market as a broke colledge student who loves games I will come cleanand admit that piracy is the only way I can afford to continue my passion. Make sure that it is not over 400/-    4.Game design: You know it. I know it. And my dogs also know it. You copied/took inspiration from fromsoftware. I understand even Wukong did it but please add something new to it. Im jus ranting so take it with a grain of salt. THE SHRINE SYSTEM AND GRACE SYSTEM IN ELDEN RING IS LITTERALY THE SAME. I don't want any foreign youtuber to say that it is a cheap copy of   Seikiro. As the avatar system has not been revealed I would not take this seriously                                                      I would like to end this by saying that you are doing god's work and dont mess this up,False,None,0
@evilhuntgaming835,Game looks good  But here are some suggestions:   1. While running the motion of character looks stiff. (looks like upper body especially the hand holding weapon is still and only legs and left arm are moving  the animation can be improved    2. The parry mechanism needs improvement  at 8:03 when our character blocks mace  it does not looks accurate(logically considering size of boss and his weapon vs our character in its normal form  once our character turns into an avatar  then some more enhanced mechanisn can be used there)  for 1 & 2 you can take inspiration from Ghost of Tushima  3. The interaction with shrine feels very fast  its like just a press of button and nothing much happens on screen which does not provide the sense of achievement for completing a part or mission. The interaction can be improved at shrine. (I know you took some reference from Black Myth Wukong and balancing it from Indian religion Pov without hurting any section of society will be challenging)   other  suggestions:   1. Performance optimization for low end devices (many of my frnds still use their 4-5 yrs old laptop with specs like  - i5 8 or 9 gen  8 gb ram  Nvidia 920MX  930MX or 1050. And even with high end machines I have seen people avoiding to push their machines to max as the laptop generated too much heat and GPU/ GPU temps are above 90 and and fans make too much noise. So despite the hardware is able to run game on high/ ultra setting people play on low/ medium setting on laptop ( key reason is they can't afford to change/ upgrade machines every 2-3 years  and they want to last it as long as possible)  2. Keeping the names of characters/ items in game a bit simpler but keeping the Indian touch and easy to pronounce especially for audience outside India as to make this project financially successful as well  a major contribution might come from other high income countries as disposable income and pc penetration in India is very low.  All the best for your journey  India definitely needed something like this,False,None,0

@Barnito-m7w,It is great that someone is doing something from India  but this is not high quality at all. The foliage comes off as a bit unrealistic because the artist used assets from Megascan without considering where each plant fits best  making it feel a bit disconnected. Some realistic  hand-painted foliage could bring it to life! Also  the character movements in combat could use some tweaking. The lack of eye movement and facial expressions makes them feel less engaging. Plus  the hair design seems to need some improvement  and it’s a little odd to see characters floating and not having any footprints. I am not against it  but it looks like a bunch of rookies created it because there are so many problems. In the end  I hope they fix all the mistakes and create a better game.,False,None,0

Quick idea : 1) how about showcasing ancient indian weapons? 2) how about treasure hunting concepts? 3) how about getting random luck when prayed in shrines? 4) bosses becoming allies? 5) how about random boosts for cleaning things like trash ? 6) how about a tree to learn moves shown in indian martial arts 7) also adding a feature to get random luck for planting trees ?

@krishnatagore5750,I appreciate that Indian games are coming. But this is just sekiro rip off with indian assets. Its not wrong to take inspiration from another game but should not copy the whole thing exactly. Like shrine as a checkpoint  sword seems like katana movement  death blow looks like owls mikiri counter  the word appearing on screen when a serious attack is coming  posture bar etc etc. Black myth handled the game mechanics properly to get a souls like feel. Here I am pointing about only game mechanics not graphics. If you want to stand out in the world  honestly with this its impossible. You need to reformulate the game mechanics again to make it different from other games. Even top tier graphic games fail due to poor game mechanics. I am not blaming about graphics which I can understand with small team you are building but you also need to change the art style to be good. But biggest priority should be game mechanics improvement. Honestly you will receive a lot of hate from hard core fans of souls games. The people in comment section are not aware of this and hence supporting. I have no right to judge you  but I am suggesting you because I want Indian gaming industry to thrive and this game at beta stage. So it can still be improved . Wish you all the best!!,False,None,0

@tejjm4263,Hey Varun and team   I’ve been playing games since I was a kid — I’m 28 now — and recently I played Ghost of Tsushima. In the gameplay you showed there were a few things I felt were missing  especially when it came to the sound design.  During combat with mid-tier or low-tier enemies  the sounds and character dialogues didn’t feel very immersive. It lacked that emotional pull or intensity. Also  the world around you should feel alive even when you’re just moving through it. Ghost of Tsushima does a good job with ambient sounds like rustling grass  birds chirping  foxes  and some NPC interactions. The Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2  those NPCs and their interactions felt much more immersive and dynamic.  All the best! Looking forward to play this!,False,None,0

@HarshitBahri,A major issue with Black Myth: Wukong was its optimization  largely due to being developed on Unreal Engine 5. This engine  while powerful  demands high-end hardware  which means the game requires expensive graphics cards and powerful PCs to run smoothly.  The game saw most of its sales from China  which makes sense given the cultural connection and the story’s roots in Journey to the West.  However  considering that the majority of Indian gamers are on mobile platforms and can’t afford a PS5 or a high-end gaming PC  this approach indirectly excludes a large portion of potential players—especially in regions like India—just for the sake of graphical realism.

@puspaltarafdar2465,Amazing effort!!! Although this is a very early build and surely a lot more will be added in the development process  here are some suggestions from me:   1.This is a fantasy game  go more artistic with the Lighting. In any fantasy game like Sekiro  Elden ring  God of War  DA Inquisition etc. you will see that they are much more artistic with their lighting choices. That’s because realistic lighting in fantasy games may look a little out of place. A more stylized lighting can make the visuals more appealing.   2.Blood splatters too far from where the impact is happening then vanishes in thin air. If there is blood  the blood should stain the clothes and skin  as well as fall on the ground and splash on the walls. If blood stains the weapon  make the character wipe off the blood as blood is highly corrosive to metal. Little details go a long way. Take inspiration from Ghost of Tsushima’s bloody combat.   3.When the player is walking there is no visual cue. If it is a muddy ground  there should be footprints  if not footprints then at least make little splashes of water. If the ground is dry  there can be a little dust whenever the foot hits the ground. Different games do it in different ways. Some kind of visual sensation will surely make the movement of the player feel better.   4.The boss is yelling  but his mouth is visibly closed at all times  looks odd. You can either animate the face with the sound or play with the lighting and headgear to subtly hide the face during the battle. Sekiro does both with different bosses.,False,None,0

@ParikritKoirala,Just a suggestion 1) Optimization is the most important thing. Even looking at the trailer it feels quite choppy.  2) that's amazing that you and your people are working hard for this but  the game needs to well managed I guess working only 1-2 years on triple A games and publishing it is not worth it.  It looks great but find some ideas and take some time to make things even better for a great experience 3) looking at the trailer chatecter model looks quite unrealistic. Especially in combat where blood scatters in unrealistic way. Like adding wounds on damaged ones would make it lot more better  4)  while looking the facial movement features should be added like in combat chatecter should look aggressive doing so will make the game even more immersive.  5) that's great you and your team has put lot of efforts but adding different combat styles and finishing move would be great    These are my perspective and some suggestion hope you find this well,False,None,0

@terribleminer7041,The game looks good but gameplay shown still lacks maybe cause its of development phase I pointed out many things there is lack of cuts  bruises  dust  water ripple  splashes  weapon swing signs  facial expressions   The heavy man hit the weapon to ground  there was only dust  no crack or hole in ground and no effect to water.  Next is the UI  its eye straining and focus will change the players hp at the left-top  item at bottom-right. Instead of going left-right or right-left   eyes will be in diagonal which is too much time taking.  Cut scenes graphics are not matching the gameplay.

@akhileshwar833,Hat's off to you. As someone wrote  make for the world  not for India.  A bit of caution: While we do have mythologies  it is also important to respect people's beliefs and not trivialize things just for making entertainment for the world. It's fine to take inspiration from mythologies but using characters should be done cautiously and respectfully. It is better not to put any gods in the game. Like we don't want a situation where a god like thor is having romance.  Also  if it is mythology inspired  then it is encouraged to also make it meaningful.    As for the game itself  i would say make it more than just India's souls-like. It should have some memorable features that are not in any Souls game but people enjoy that a lot. Idk  maybe aerial fights or flying. Maybe include controllable spatial and time powers. And make the world more alive where not everyone wants to attack you lol. Include things like cows maybe. And please don't get restricted due to 'India's first soul-like': it's just about being a but more creative and having a bit more ideas  which can elevate the game to a whole new level. And since it is based in India  an lot of ancient Indian weapons can be included which i am sure you are including. Even mythological weapons like Sudarshan chakra can be cool. You can also add things like temples  where fight is forbidden  giving respect can unlock some powers or heal and there could be some teachings there as well. As in sleeping dogs  in buddhist shrines  lighting incense increases health bar. In the end  i wohld again emphasize  do not be constrained by the term Souls-like. U could create situations where we are traveling on a ship and are fighting in a ship  it's not one vs all situation but there can be necessary ncp allies as well.,False,None,0

@speed.exe26,If what was mentioned in this video is all true  then it is a huge step forward in a right direction. As someone who has played a lot of AAAs  RPGs I can say that the graphics look great. It can rival many big name games as you mentioned. As for the story  if done right then it could be a great success. My only concern is that the gameplay looks janky and you mentioned that it is inspired by sekiro but this in game footage made fights look easy. But in qny case  you have taken up a huge risk and I pray for your success. Many don't realise how big of a leap it is for India as a country nit just for you guys. I hope you succeed and that success indpires a lot more indians who have the talent but doesn't want to take the risk or pursue it. I am waiting to buy the gane and test it for myself.

@sanket.solanke,Everything in the demo looked ugly together. I know it's alpha footage  but you can polish it 100 times and it'll still look ugly. I hope the style is drastically different in final product. More visually harmonic and less chaotic random.  Hire a director  or take help from someone. World building is a big part of any game. You have to do that with not just the story but visually too.  Imagine a game like god of war  but instead of being set in ancient Greece  it is set in slums of Mumbai with "bollywood" twist.  Every once in a while there is a game maker in India who try to make a "game set in India" and not a game. Don't fall into same trap.  Sure assets are good  may be mechanics are good to but you want to tell a story inspired of Ramayan  set in a slum  there is a guy with a sword dressed out of time  there is police in uniform and guns  a guy in safari with pipe  a giant south Indian with a mace  "bollywood" style and everything looks a mess. Is it similar to some places in India? Yes. But it looks like a place most people would not like to be in.   Make something beautiful not realistic.

@hectera,It is deeply disappointing when a piece of media chooses to represent India solely through the lens of poverty  especially by showcasing slums as the primary visual identity. India is a nation of vast diversity  rich culture  and breathtaking landscapes—from the snow-capped Himalayas and lush backwaters of Kerala to the architectural marvels of Rajasthan and the vibrant skylines of modern cities like Bengaluru and Mumbai. Reducing this incredible country to a single stereotype is not only lazy storytelling  but also deeply disrespectful to the millions who take pride in their heritage and progress.  Such representation fuels the global misconception that India equals poverty  ignoring the fact that the nation is also home to one of the world’s fastest-growing economies  a booming tech industry  and a youthful  innovative population. Developers and content creators have a responsibility to portray cultures with depth and nuance—not with tired clichés. While it’s true that every country has its struggles  it’s unfair to highlight only the flaws while ignoring the beauty  resilience  and brilliance that define its people. It's time for the world to see India beyond the slums  and recognize the elegance  energy  and excellence it truly embodies.,False,None,0

@ADI-xp4qe,As a 3D artist myself I wanted to share few thoughts let me know if they are constructive.  To start off  good job with putting the efforts  i think things are in right direction but can be pushed further  So  firstly i think it's important to understand what your game is aiming towards gameplay or narrative. Great games have a balance of both but it's subjective at the same time  like detroit is a great narrative based game while doom has crazy good gameplay. So from that point of view I feel the vision is missing from the trailer. Again you can argue we have story through art and have gameplay. But  I think narrative should not be spoonfed to the audience on a primary level it's fine but you can always aim for complexity to get better results.  My suggestion talk or hire gameplay designers and narrative designers who have great experience in this domain and have a vision what do you want to showcase. It doesn't have to be rocket science  just proper vision towards the goal.  Second  problem with photogrammetry from an artistic standpoint. While it's great that you have used scans to recreate this whole settings  there are few issues with it. 1st you can't use unreals PBR to full potential because most of the data is borrowed from real life and they act as buffer to enhance the artistic aspects. So  in short i think it's important to aim for less is more.  Second  there was a wide contrast between the characters the props and environment  from a style pov. Which made things unrelated and inconsistent.   I have showcased artistic feedback later because i understand the technical limitations and this being your first game i understand the sheer ignorance with development you guys will have and its great that you are on this endeavour to push things and our industry i 100% support this thing and looking forward to your progress. And i believe you man you do listen to your audience  so I hope you go through this feedback too.   Hope this helps Goodluck,False,None,0

@xXApexPredator,Congratulations on reaching this exciting stage with your game. Even in its early alpha build  it’s clear that a great deal of passion  creativity  and technical skill has gone into it. The foundation you’ve laid shows strong potential.  As you move forward  I encourage you to focus deeply on gameplay  narrative depth  character responsiveness  and progression systems—these are what truly define a memorable player experience.  There’s a unique opportunity here to ground the game in Indian culture and storytelling. Think Ghost of Tsushima—a game that thrived by staying authentic. This could be India’s Uncharted or Tomb Raider: cinematic  tightly designed  and rooted in local heritage. I’d recommend avoiding an open-world format and instead crafting a refined  narrative-driven journey.  Take the time you need to polish it—quality outlasts deadlines. You’re on the right path. Keep pushing—this could be something truly special.,False,None,0

@okirenvader1692,ye teaser tha ya trailer nahi samajh aya then again when you see studios like cd project red their trailers and teasers introduce the player to the world of the game and are really convincing so much so that a person would really be interested in investing their time and mooney in that game. you claimed that the game is going to be india's first high quality game yet you are going to release it in 2026 instead of taking 7 years which is the ususal time big studios take to make and launch their games so that not only do they stand up to the quality requirements but also provide more that 40 hrs of content. whatt is the budget of this game? again claiming it to be high quality sounds a bit too far fetched as the gameplay looks choppy i know you might fix that but that is not the biggest problem here   tell me why does the HUD look so unpolished and uninspiring.

@VinitR,I really like what you presented  gameplay. Although the presentation could look more engaging if you have at least two speakers  makes the viewer feel part of the team. One suggestion I have for your team: Take feedbacks with a grain of salt  so many people nag about a lot without understanding market research  what is trending  keywords a user would expect from a premise. E.g. the slums are a unique environment and I knew before clicking that viewers will hate it. It is perfectly fine for an RPG to start with modest levels with modest environments moving to different varied levels. You will also get nostalgia factor from overseas users from the Slumdog millionaire movie.,False,None,0

@swastikchatterjee407,I must say that such a benchmark you guys have created for the indian game development industry i am also a unity game developer and we are also working on a fps game project  so as a game dev i have to say that the theme is not really mathcing with the whole story it seems that you are trying to mix wukong with uncharted lost legacy but this is not giving us a very good result. According to me this particular slum type theme is best suitable for COD like stealth mission based gameplay not for this one this kind of gameplay is best suited in the Himalayas or kedarnath type of religious areas and villains also should be more mythological or supernatultal vibed not a police man or a woman this is not gta bro. But apart from this the sound design  the game design  animations  vfx is 10 on 10.   keep working on this project and make standard to compete internationally we arr always here to motivate you.,False,None,0
@Vishwasssss,I can clearly see that the game is heavily inspired by sekiro. But as a souls like game you should explore different games based on this genre as it will help to create a unique game rather than a souls like clone. For Now You should focus on smooth animations. The attack and deflect animations look very choppy ( fix their timing and increase their spacing )  and also the deathblow animation need a massive overhaul as it feel very weird. And work on skill trees and add different tools variety which will help gamers to play with different strategies. The Game needs so much work so don't rush it. Take atleast 3-4 years imo to polish the game properly. You can also release a demo version so that you will get gamers response to improve your game just like The First Berserker Khazan did.

@AshwinPrakash-e4f,I'm really happy and concerned that you are stepping into a very risky zone in the indian market. I know this is an alpha  but these are my thoughts: 1) The character's leg animation  I loved it mostly. 2) The dirt interactions on the ground. 3) The overall setting and background looks promising   Now to the imp parts. 1) The name of game  ui  hud look way too generic. The name could be something very imdicative of the narration or character  if you think of it the name suites many fantasy AAA games..where a power is unleashed. The Ui should be such which prompts to player to start the game. It should be a part of the story. The hud  i think it's overly being indianized  just to be indian  a national pride is awesome but shouldn't overshadow the game. As in an american game or a chinese game wont shout chinese out. So keep some things like the hud minimalistic yet original to the game. 2) If the gameplay showcased is an actual part of the story  then it's lackluster  as in..there's not much context..im pretty sure there's more to it!  3) The charater movements and attacks shouldn't be just a button click and animate..it should feel cohesive.  4) Character eye contact and expressions should be improved (I liked that giant mans face after that show off  excellent for an alpha of the build)  I'll edit if I notice more  full support. Nail it.  Don't just creat a fantasic product but also do fantastic marketing to get it put there. Do large collabs  celebs  actors...if both aspects are in place  I'm sure you'll nail it. Looking forward to play this game️,False,None,0

My expectation for a first game of a studio isn't too high and i'm not comparing to rockstar but even comparing to small independent games like outer wilds(a masterpiece btw)  this just doesn't stand out. i dont think i'd play this game even for free if this is the end result.  This looks like a soulslike game but it looks too easy for a soulslike tbh.   I really wish to play a game in indian setting. hope you make it better. good luck.,False,None,0

@AriyaGavisti,Alright man  as much as I wanna appreciate your efforts there are so many things you are neglecting. One of them being your own audience. Now  I don't know how the final version would be but right now I just don't see much soul into it. Also using Unreal 5 could be a death sentence. It's one of the most unoptimized engine available. Another thing is it being an "AAA" title  that already comes with a lot of expectations. That give rise to a lot of worries people should be having. The price  performance  content. Not saying you don't have it figured out but the presentation certainly didn't give me anything to chew on.   You can very well prove me wrong. But so far it looks soulless  uninspired  buzzword ripoff of a franchise that I personally hold dear to my heart  and it's just not me. Hopefully next time you show the game at least some of my concerns could be proven wrong. Again man  not hating on it but can't just jump into trusting an "AAA developer" after everything going on in the industry.  Cautiously optimistic though. Next presentation will be telling.,False,None,0

@aliveoceans,The game looks visually stunning and the gameplay seems quite engaging—great work to the team!  However  I’d like to share a serious concern about the portrayal of the final villain. His appearance  especially with the tilak and vibhuti (sacred ash) on his forehead  strongly resembles that of a Hindu priest or devotee.  I understand the intention might be to depict a Ravana-like character  but in reality  these symbols are worn by countless peaceful and devout Hindus as part of their spiritual practice. Using them to represent evil risks promoting harmful stereotypes.  Frankly  if this were done by someone unfamiliar with Indian culture—say  a foreign developer—it might be seen as ignorance  misunderstanding  or even bias. But when something like this is created by Indians  in India  it becomes deeply disappointing and shameful. Our own creators should know better than to misrepresent sacred traditions for dramatic effect.  I hope future portrayals will handle cultural and religious symbolism more responsibly. Looking forward to seeing how the game evolves.,False,None,0

@Ujjwal9078,Comment box:-  Donation box:- ️ Some advice from my side :- However  the game is good but i like the scene where the player finally fighting with main boss that boss fighting was something unique other than those normal gundaas   so u should fix the players fighting style becoz he only fight with the same basic moves you should add some more moves and do something that players can fight with different weapons too just think about it   and also give some more characters too so that players can choose on their own preferences and style atlast add some building too or you can choose the location where a lot of greenery present.

@inbuiltablecrow7553,DAMN! .. I tried to avoid watching this trailer cause from the thumbnails it looked like another wannabe gta clone.. BUT HECK! didn't expect a souls like to pop out instead!  Let me guess  you guys took inspiration from Black myth Wukong  and thought why not represent India in the same way  BUT during the gameplay and (Especially) in audio department I'm smelling a little bit of LIES OF P!!  (Anyone else does too?) (One of my most favorite games of all time though  so I was equally shocked and happy when the 'sword clash' sounded pretty familiar! )  The environment looks Uncharted 4 remastered level (which is amazing!)  though the animations sure look ps2 level (no offense  I know it's a very early build)  guess it'll take atleast 2 years to polish all that out.  Though  I would really prefer if you take all the time you guys require to polish it like a diamond  instead of hurrying and putting like out all those buggy  glitchy  abominations we were getting from real 3A studios .  You guys are right... If you can pull this off  I can finally see other Indians getting a confidence boost  and who knows  maybe we'll get our own Soul's aside  Wukong or stellar blade by 2030?  I don't know if you guys will read my comment or not  but I'd like to wish you guys all the best from my bottom of my heart!! Please make it awesome!! .

@xunchann,5:30 Starting    As the game has maintained such high quality environment and realism in its surroundings I (not speaking for others) personally would expect  to see more things be logical and consistent  Some might say why am I expecting logics in game  games aren't real  things are very much made up in it. Then here is the timestamp 12:30 where Varun himself talks about how they care about little details like window  handle of auto and scooter & so  to fix the imperfections. When such little detail matters then I think battles and interaction of the character with other things should also have same consistency to make sense. I hope this comment is taken as constructive criticism because if devs are talking about quality and perfection I think as a user I have the ability to criticize about it as well.    6:20 The ground is wet and muddy  how come the character is running on a wet ground making no noise and sneaking up on enemy what sort of stealth is that? It would make more sense if enemy was more aggro and not just walking around with no sense of danger.    6:45 again if you look at the environment it is very much real looking  but the blood looks totally cartoonish as its some RPG game  painted on top of scene  you can pause your video around this timestamp and see how inconsistent things are.    8:51 The cutscene  finger of the boss enemy looks like noodles as it has no bones  too long and thin as compared to whole size of the boss enemy itself same for the other side of arm  looks deformed inconsistent size and shape     Overall the map seems very narrow and small  5-6 enemy after just few steps in game and then a boss fight?  If there was even 3-4 lines of story telling it would look and feel much better  hopefully in official teaser things will make more sense.  And now some brutal inputs  pehli baat toh I don't understand why all Indian devs or creators khudka product launch karke emotion selling kyu karte hai? Indian culture ko represent karna hai but aisa kya character ko dhoti dediya villains are some ruthless civilians and bad police men? and thoda religious Ramayana or Mahabharat ke story ki touch dedo or emotion selling hojayegi kisi god ke avatar ko showcase kardo kya hai ye sab no matter how high quality the game is made in what's the point of it when the same typical mistake continues which other industries failed to fix as well,False,None,0

@Koro_Sensei_,I think why we can't make a profitable game for the indian market other than a mobile game is infrastructure of the people  as in most teens or indians don't have a powerful enough laptop or a pc which they can afford   I mean sure we have become more progressive where indians have become a bit more financially secure enough to afford it but most still don't  why would they put money into something when they don't have a high paying salary   how to eat healthy   how to not die of the heat   how to help the family or support the family  how to support a wife and the family  how will you make a family for yourself and take care of your parents. Will you have enough time    Now this is for most   but yes financially indipendent people have grown a lot in india doesn't mean they make the majority of indians.   You're already studying till 24 -26 you need experience to get anything in this life and no one is willing to provide you that even if you beg for the most parts. By the time you earn enough its 30 and past gotta marry and a family both work take care of things sleeping would be a vacation.   What im trying to say most adult indians would have a lack of free capital  lack of expendable time without compromising other things   you've gotta dedicate time for this  while mobile games are quick   prota ble and free to download and play.   I have no clue why im typing this nor am i the said things above yet . Im just gonna say im supporting this by commenting and liking this   i won't be able to play this game until i get a pc gaming set up with graphics processing   i just have a asus tuf laptop thats handling current games.

@Its_frenzy_shorts,Jo clips tumne dikhaye hain  woh thode realistic toh lag rahe hain  lekin natural bilkul nahi lagte. Aisa lag raha hai jaise random assets ko ek saath daal diya gaya ho bina proper composition ke — pura 3D environment ek cluttered scene jaisa lag raha hai. Haan  tumne 3D scan technology use kiya hai  but models abhi bhi utne polished nahi lag rahe ki unhe ek high-quality ya so-called AAA game mein use kiya ja sake.  Animations bhi bilkul vibe ke saath match nahi kar rahe — unmein polish ki kami hai aur woh kaafi unprofessional lag rahe hain. Overall movement aur transitions mein koi proper flow ya consistency nahi dikh raha.  Aur sabse important baat — tumne ab tak gameplay mechanism ka ek bhi part dikhaya nahi hai. Jab tak woh clear nahi hota  tab tak hum game ke core experience ke baare mein kuch bol hi nahi sakte.  Thoda environment design refine karo  animations ko improve karo  aur gameplay ka thoda glimpse dikhana start karo — tabhi log fair opinion de paayenge.,False,None,0

@pranjalshukla8096,I am hoping you and your team do great but but but please take in all the criticism you can and dont expect the game to be massive success overnight from the very first game you make  other Asian studio from Japan  Korea  China etc  made gacha games - kept on improving their game continuously there is no shame in earning few buck by showing a sexy lady if the game is great  (I know its not possible in India) take any gacha game for example if not take any Final Fantasy game (final fantasy 1 through 16) for example to name a few  (or the most recent Stellar Blade for example) All I want from you is  put your best effort in the game  do not set the game in the slums  do not fall into the stereotype trap if possible   I know you are making a difference in the Indian game market  I do not want you to fail but do not even compare this with the likes of souls game  or wukong  I would also urge you to make a single player-story telling game in the future as well  any setting like Project IGI  Unchartered  and arcade game..... etc. Now Battlefield and COD (without the multiplayer alone is a big ask)  I hope you find this input in some capacity useful  everyone  including those who are criticizing this  have very high hope that this succeed. best wishes,False,None,0

@Rudra_om,8:13 Even if you make some changes(low) to the graphics  improve these things.  Here the player is attacking the enemy So the clothes of the enemy should be damaged and the body of the enemy should have internal organs which should be exposed And look at the blood coming out from there it looks like GTA 3Graphics: Even if you run it in full high quality on a good graphics card But when it comes to an average gamer  he will not have such good playability in high quality and his FC will also not be much.And inside it will just feel like playing Tekken 3 in HD Work a little on it  like making it more compatible with the environment and attacking it  and on its clothes and all this  work a little on it I know it hasn't been completed yet  but 20-30% or whatever  it is complete. But still there is work to be done on these things because the better these things will be  fighting skills  fighting animations  taking damage  interaction with the player  with NPP  with the enemy  with one's own body You will enjoy the game play just as much Even if you make some changes(low) to the graphics  improve these things.,False,None,0

@swlchl,Let me preface this by saying I'm so glad someone's decided to take India a step forward into the gaming industry  and the effort you and your team have put into this is undeniable... but at least in its current state  from what was shown in the trailer  the game's mechanics seem very derivative of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice  to the point of being a borderline clone  and I find it disheartening that despite putting an incredible amount of effort into the art  assets and world  you've taken such a derivative approach to your gameplay. From the mechanics to even the animations and indicators  everything about the combat shown in that trailer looks like it was reskinned from Sekiro  and for the first AAA game from India to be a Sekiro reskin really doesn't sit right with me... I hope you can still take the game in a different direction because I'm really excited about its prospect  but this is not the way to go about designing your core systems.,False,None,0

@shourya1995,well the game looks very good the animation and gameplay but the concept you are using too weird  killing peoples  with blood splash in a slum which will make people to actually believe india is dirty which is  but only in some most of the citys are clean and i would recommend that you should make your game like ancient india scenenary(like eldin ring but ancient india environment) showing indian temples and enemies rakhash from mahabharat. I would rate  the gameplay 7/10 (fighting system can more good ) animation 8/10(make it more smooth) concept of environment 2/10(its just pain to watch).

I think best sound design in a game is sifu(of a similar genre)  In seikiro  hear the metal cling sound when you parry perfectly and I see a lot of seikro in it but i think the target lock in a person needs to be toggle switch like in jedi fallen order. By default target lock should be off.  The environment is great but the AMBIANCE feels all over the place  (just check sifu  each level  has a theme even with respect to colours too(if I'm not wrong they use Analogous colors in each level)  Lies of p colour is blue with a dark environment Right now from what you showed it looks like a mundane day in India.

@cyrus2306,The setting doesn't feel very soulslike. It's like you're making this game for the sake of making a game  there is no real passion it looks very forced. You could've used an ancient indian setting with so many mythologies just lying around you could've used some as a starting point. I don't want to fight policemen and then goons right after lol,False,None,0
@aminsyedwww,While China developed Wukong  here we have this shit.  To top it off  they had to make it such an obvious and cheap knockoff of Souls/Elden Ring. Do something original ffs! Individual modders have developed better mods for games than this piece of crap. It's DOA already.,False,None,0

Please stop telling until you really ready to launch the game ...bcz before you there were several so called indian games which were announced in 2020 but still not launched ...they scammed us ...somehow it looks like prince of Persia copy ... Do better ...I am a hard core gamer and i am still not impressed...need multiplayer souls like Indian game based on mediaeval on ancient theme not modern theme and single player ..no no no !,False,None,0

@ro_ohitt,Wish you all the best for the game and hope it is as good as you say it is. But the thing is a game is not only about its graphics. A game is so much more. The gameplay  the story  the character  the locations  the atmosphere  and much more. The game play feels very lacking. You keep talking about how much efforts went into making the assets and scaning them n etc but truthfully no one cares. You are making a game not creating a animation studio or something like that all games do it. Heck there are games that have hand drawn graphics and those games are really good and millions of people play them. So focus more on making a polished bug free game with unique combat mechanics. Also dont go about saying we worked so hard on this we did this n that so many sleepless nights wagera wagera. No one cares. All gaming studious are doing what you are doing. It is not something that is new. Also the ui really sucks and so does the sound design.,False,None,0

@agcrgaming7275,@VarunMayya you are doing great brother but i will recommend that you change the fighting mechanism and add more mechanism to match global standards. It looks amazing but might make a little darker environment for souls like vibe . The movement can be refined too. But the textures are good . But the high polygan models gonna take alot of resources... And might keep the death body there rather then make them disappear in thin air . And you can add kicks and other weapons. The hero is stiff looking... Might make him look agile for a different vibe.   The graphics is amazing  great job I didn't complain but said some idea that I think might help u improving it,False,None,0
